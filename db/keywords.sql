President and I do thank the chamber for its indulgence I have really enjoyed the bulk of my five years representing South ns in the Senate It has been a privilege to participate in Union dominated It is fifty fifty The Superannuation  Amendment Trustee Obligations and Prudential Standards Bill 2012 does a number of things It increases obligations on superannuation fund trustees and directors both generally for all super fund trustees and specifically for MySuper trustees It also gives I ve fallen asleep 8212 it was so exciting Union dominated 8212 Yes union dominated super funds And I can see that Minister Conroy like Minister Shorten is right on song The government should withdraw this provision and then embark on a proper consultation process with all participants in the superannuation industry The government continues to ignore those many sensible and important corporate governance recommendations from the Cooper review because the Labor government and Minister Shorten continue to put the interests of their friends in union dominated industry super funds ahead of Minister Conroy is now getting active again on the interjection front The coalition will propose a logical and sensible amendment that would address significant concerns with this bill in relation to the scale test In government should we be successful I speak in support of the Superannuation  Amendment Trustee Obligations and Prudential Standards Bill Superannuation is the backbone of the strength of the n economy  a relatively small nation in terms of our population with around 22 million As Senator Conroy points out the cheapest funds were the industry superannuation funds They were the best performing and the cheapest so naturally workers and investors flocked to the industry funds It backfired on the opposition and it will again And they were cheaper I would like to indicate my support for the provisions in the Superannuation  Amendment Trustee Obligations and Prudential Standards Bill 2012 particularly those aimed at greater accountability and transparency for superannuation funds But we need to go further The I would like to acknowledge Senator Xenophon s contribution and the thought he has put into the issue of personal superannuation One of the biggest problems that I see in this area is of course that lack of engaged consumers I would like to thank those people who made a contribution to this debate particularly Senator Thistlethwaite who I thought accurately depicted the nature of this  and also Senator Xenophon who I also think had a valuable contribution to My question is to Senator Evans the Minister representing  I refer to the Leader of the Government in the Senate s address to the Refugee Council of  on 17 November 2008 when he was the immigration I had the advantage of talking to Mr Paris Aristotle a member of the Houston review this morning He pointed out to me the very strong differences in approach in terms of using Nauru and Manus Island for the detention Order Senator Evans you just might  your seat It might be much easier As I was saying it was a regime based on punishment and trying to convince people that if you hurt them they would stop coming Having read the Houston  it recommends a very different approach I had the pleasure Order Senator Cormann and Senator Evans Interjections are disorderly Senator Cormann do you want to have a go I am happy to point the finger at you again Senator Cormann I remember you saying offshore processing was wrong I thank Senator Abetz for  I do not know whether those are exactly accurate remarks but I suspect they are and I did have great pleasure in abolishing the Pacific solution I continue to have the view that Mr President I ask a  Given the government has now adopted one element of the Pacific solution 8212 namely reopening Nauru and Manus Island 8212 will it now also adopt the other elements of the Pacific solution that The government has sought to implement the recommendations of the Houston review Despite attempts by the opposition to misinterpret what has been said I have read the  8212 unlike many opposite I suspect 8212 and that is not what Order There is  of order at this stage The minister has 49 seconds remaining The obvious point to Senator Abetz is to say that we have adopted the recommendations of the Houston  That will form the basis of  being introduced in this parliament I think later today  and all senators Mr President I rise on a point of order My  did not refer to the  at all What I am seeking is the government s position  continues to misrepresent what the  says I will look to find the actual quote Mr President I ask a further  Just to clarify is it the government s position that it will not turn around a boat even if it is safe and possible to do so If so why My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Disability Reform Senator Evans Can the minister update the Senate on the rollout of the National Disability Insurance Scheme I thank Senator Moore for her long term interest in this issue The Gillard government is absolutely committed to delivering a National Disability Insurance Scheme An NDIS will make sure we are delivering the kind of care and support ns Mr President I ask a  Can the minister advise the Senate on how the announcement of the launch site in Victoria will benefit people in the Barwon region The government are very pleased that with the Victorian government we have agreed to a launch site in Victoria in the Barwon region From July this year about 5 000 Victorians with significant and profound disabilities their families and their In developing the NDIS the government has committed to engaging with people with disability their carers and families and the community more broadly To involve those ns most closely associated with disability the government is funding the National Disability and Mr President I ask a further  Can the minister also advise the Senate on how the government is working with the community on the development of the NDIS Thank you Mr President You can t have it both ways You cannot say The mining tax doesn t collect any revenue but will also simultaneously kill the mining industry That is the hypocrisy of the other side Thank you Mr President Order That is debating the issue Minister I draw your attention to  You have got seven seconds remaining Have you finished Minister Order Minister Come to  up jumps George saying Oh no don t talk about us We don t want you to talk about us Minister come to  We got to sooky la la pretty quickly didn t we As soon as anybody starts talking about them 8212 There is  of order The minister is answering  and she does have 25 seconds I am listening closely to the minister s answer The minister has 25 seconds remaining to answer  Mr President I raise a point of order on direct relevance The minister has just told us that she is not going to provide the figure which is the subject of  She is now making comment on what As I was going on to say in the last budget we updated and revised the MRRT revenue to 13 4 billion over the forward estimates As Senator Cormann well knows from  in this place and in Senate estimates There is  of order I believe the minister is answering  The minister has one minute and 30 seconds remaining Mr President I rise on a point of order It goes to the requirement for the minister to be directly relevant to  I asked the minister a very specific question which was how much has the government collected I thank Senator Cormann for  I do not know how I have managed for the last six weeks without  from Senator Cormann but I struggled through In terms of the MRRT as you know Mr President I My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer Senator Wong Minister how much revenue from the minerals resource rent tax has the government collected in July this year by leave 8212 I move That the order of the day be referred to the Federation Chamber Question agreed to Before I call  I wish to inform the House that we have present in the gallery  a former Attorney General who is a former member for Parkes and Berowra 8212 a distinguished record 8212 the Mr President I ask a  Why is the government not in a position to provide the information I sought in relation to MRRT revenue collected by the government in the month of July when  made Through you Mr President I will say this to Senator Cormann about the figures 8212 and I will go back and check this because I do not have a comprehensive brief on the July position my recollection and it is Mr President I seek leave to table a copy of  s letter to then Senator Brown on 18 March 2012 in which she made the promise that she would publish monthly updates on revenue collections from the Mr President I am just having a look at the letter but I am happy to take that motion at the end of  so that we can have a look at the letter first Coming from a man who knows he has to find at least 70 billion of cuts to services that ns need and we can see in the Victorian Liberal government and in the Newman government in Queensland precisely the approach Mr President I ask a further  If the government cannot even stick to a promise  made to her alliance partner the Greens how can anyone else in  trust any of  s My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Resources and Energy Senator Evans Does the government agree with the coalition energy spokesperson Mr Ian Macfarlane but not its leader Mr Abbott that some state governments have been profiting I thank Senator Milne for her question There is a great deal of community concern about the increases in household electricity prices that we have seen over the last three years I understand that in many areas prices have increased Mr President I ask a  Given  s concern about the higher than necessary electricity  because of the incentive to sell more electricity instead of helping energy efficiency when can the community expect the implementation I think  is right to point to the need to target energy savings approaches as part of dealing with these issues It is part of why we have implemented a carbon price as part of our encouragement of While I am sure Minister Ferguson acted for exactly the right motives and was driven by sound public policy I have not actually been briefed as to why 8212 Senator Brandis interjecting 8212 No it does not hurt me at Mr President I ask a further  Finally why did Minister Ferguson claim that the NEM objective is universally supported when the evidence is to the contrary Minister can you tell me which of the ongoing inquiries address the My question is to the Minister representing  Senator Evans I refer the minister to the same speech as Senator Milne referred him to 8212 the one to the Energy Policy Institute of  given by the Prime What about the carbon price Can I say to the good senator that  has been aware for some time as we all have about the growing community concern about the increasing costs of electricity in  It has been a concern that Senator if that is wrong I stand to be corrected But the last time I checked the state governments were responsible for the setting and control of the electricity systems in their states The carbon price will have an impact on electricity prices 8212 something that we have made clear for a very long time It is also the case that the family assistance package shaped by this government that has been paid Won t the carbon price have an impact on electricity prices Mr President I ask a  I thank the minister for his answer As the minister indicated given that  and the Labor government have apparently had concerns about rising electricity prices for some length of time I gather  s question seeks to criticise the government and  for responding to community concerns I do not know where he has been He certainly has not been in Western  where the Barnett government I have a further  Mr President If  and the Labor government are serious about the impact of mounting electricity prices on so many n households and businesses why won t the government do the one The approach adopted by the opposition is fundamentally dishonest in that it seeks to pretend that the major driver of electricity price increases in this country is driven by the carbon price They know that is false and no one My question is to the Minister for Sport Senator Lundy With the London summer Olympic Games now officially ended can the minister advise the Senate of  s performance at the games and our athletes achievements I believe all ns are incredibly proud of how our athletes performed at the London summer Olympics over the last two weeks Our team hit the benchmark that was anticipated of 35 medals and while there may have been a Mr President I ask a  Can the minister update the Senate on the role that n businesses and experts played in making London the successful games that it was by leave 8212 I associate myself with the comments that have already been made and I congratulate the member for Wentworth on his fitting and eloquent tribute to Robert Hughes and for reminding all of us what a great chamber I thank Senator Thistlethwaite for this question because ns had a wonderful role to play in the success of the London games I begin by congratulating the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games for delivering an exceptional experience As    was asked not just about offshore processing but also about the other two legs of the coalition policy stool which are turning back the boats where it is safe to do so and also The government later today will seek to introduce amendments that will enable us to commence processing on Nauru and on PNG in the form recommended in this  There have been good faith discussions between the government and the opposition  should be aware of the appropriate use of props The member for Greenway It is a testament to Aussie innovation that the creator of the magnificent Olympic flame and cauldron was thanks to South n company FCT Flames run by Con Manias I also met Mr Manias whilst at the Austrade function I You need respond to that part that applies to your portfolio Mr President I ask a further  Can the minister inform the Senate on any n involvement in the creation of the London Olympic cauldron and has the minister yet rowed down the Thames My question is to  and I thank  for finally adopting one element in the coalition s border protection policy 8212 namely offshore processing in Nauru When will  adopt the other two The Manager of Opposition Business will  his seat  is answering  and has the call As to the Leader of the Opposition s question the government has endorsed in principle the recommendations of this  here a  put together by three very eminent ns 8212 Angus Houston a former Chief of the Defence Force My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency Senator Wong Is the government considering any changes to the operation of the carbon tax that would increase the effective price paid by liable entities I assume that the good senator by that question is referencing various newspaper s rather than 8212 Senator Birmingham interjecting 8212 Actually I think it was the Financial Review but I am happy to say the n if you want It was a broad question I can tell  that the government is not considering imposing a 1 300 per year impost on n families unlike his party I can tell  that the government is not considering I do draw the minister s attention to  The minister has 52 seconds remaining Order Senator Wong  your seat It is a very broad question but certainly in relation to the floor price the government have made clear that we have undertaken extensive consultations We have certainly received a number of submissions regarding the operation of the floor price Order Ignore the interjections Senator Wong Just continue on the answer Mr President I rise on a point of order On the issue of direct relevance it was as the minister said a broad question But even the breadth of that question did not extend beyond asking whether the government was My question is to  How is the government getting on with the job of implementing the recommendations of the expert panel  on asylum seekers I thank the member for Greenway for her question and note that she is back from maternity leave and that baby Octavia is in the gallery watching Mum at work It is great to see baby Octavia and husband Michael Mr President I ask a  Does the government stand by its budget ions that under current rules the carbon price will be trading at 29 in 2015 16 and will generate 6 7 billion for the government The government undertook very extensive modelling which underpinned the budget ions That modelling was of course very extensive Treasury modelling which was based on estimates of long term developments and international carbon markets as well as the assumption consistent with Taking a lecture on being upfront about their policy from those opposite who will not even let me deal with their policy at all in  is really a little rich  is in fact a hypothetical The Mr President I ask a further  Is it not the case that the carbon tax looks increasingly likely to plummet to its floor price when the fixed price is removed in 2015 and that the government is currently Honourable Senators Honourable senators interjecting 8212 My question is to  I remind  that on over 100 occasions over the past four years the coalition has called on her to swallow her pride and pick up the phone to the President Have you or you will you commission an independent scientific monitoring program to help you assess this  in light of the mounting evidence that the EIA  is insufficient in its assessment process Order On my left Senator Siewert is entitled to be heard in silence Thank you I refer to the Browse Basin LNG processing plant planned for James Price Point in the Kimberley and ask are you aware that Woodside the proponent for the development has significantly underestimated the number of whales in the Wait a minute Senator Siewert You are entitled to be heard in silence My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Sustainability Environment Water Population and Communities Senator Conroy I refer to the environmental impact assessment process 8212 As the  is well aware for some time now the government has indicated that it has been prepared to compromise in order to secure offshore processing In particular for some time now the government has indicated that it I thank Senator Siewert for her  We are working with the Western n government on a strategic assessment of this proposal The state assessment process continues and finalisation of the state  must precede finalisation of the strategic assessment The last part of  is and work in the national interest to tackle people smuggling and deter people from taking dangerous boat journeys to  The member for Banks will  his seat Before I call the minister 8212 the minister will  his seat 8212 I will have silence as I actually did not hear the last part of  Mr Abbott interjecting Opposition Members Opposition members interjecting 8212 My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and it is about the expert panel  on asylum seeker policy Why is it important for the parliament to listen to the advice of experts and work in the Mr President I am not asking what the decision is I am asking how they are going to make the decision and whether they will seek independent scientific advice as they cannot rely on the Woodside assessment process So further I thank the honourable member for his question I am sure the whole House would like to thank Angus Houston Michael L Estrange and Paris Aristotle for their fine work and their very thorough  8212 three men with very The government has received an application under sections 9 and 10 of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act to protect an area near James Price Point The act requires that a  be commissioned in response to Mr President it was nice the minister was answering  I did not even ask so I will try again with a further  How is the government going to undertake to make the decision Is the government I thank Senator Siewert for her additional question I am happy to seek further information from Minister Burke on that specific issue I will take that on notice for you My question is to the Minister for Agriculture Fisheries and Forestry Senator Ludwig I refer the minister to the National Food Plan green paper released on 17 July Given the importance of ensuring that ns have access to a secure I thank Senator Williams for that dorothy The n government is actively working to deliver the nation s first ever National Food Plan 8212 a commitment we made at the last election  s first National Food Plan is an My question is to  I remind  that just six weeks ago she rejected the coalition s call to reopen the Nauru processing centre saying The experts have looked the Leader of the Opposition in The Manager of Opposition Business will  his seat  will answer  before the chair   I rise on a point of order on relevance  was asked a very simple question does she stand by her statement six weeks ago that the experts have looked the Leader of the Opposition The member backs in the point I was making in answer to the earlier question which is that the government were well and truly prepared to compromise in the last parliamentary session in order to secure  so that we As I was just about to say on  of processing on Nauru the government received advice about what the impact of having a detention centre on Nauru would be if it took that step We received that advice I thank Senator Williams for his question The policy options within the green paper as I was saying include supply chain relationship research and development how we boost  s agricultural productivity through rural R amp D investment It also Mr President I have a  If the government is to be believed on its promise to increase  s food producing capacity why won t it give consideration to the construction of dams that can help increase the I have a further  Mr President Can the minister explain why the National Food Plan does not mention the live export industry given that it is worth 1 billion to  s economy and given the industry s I rise on a point of order Mr President in relation to direct relevance The second  is directly in relation to live exports 8212 why weren t live exports mentioned in the plan My  is to  How can Nauru have been so wrong six weeks ago and yet be so right today Order There is  of order I am listening to the minister s answer carefully The minister has 36 seconds remaining to answer  Thank you Of course extensive stakeholder consultation is underway on the green paper so one would expect that under the headings of those policy options which included market access and issues around supply chain relationship those who want to provide I thank Senator Williams for his second  Again the policy options which are outlined in the green paper do include issues around supply chain relationships how we foster stronger relationships for the benefit of suppliers supermarkets and consumers My question is to the Minister for Broadband Communications and the Digital Economy Senator Conroy Can the minister advised that the Senate on recent developments with the National broadband network Opposition Senators Opposition senators interjecting 8212 Order Senator Cameron is entitled to be heard in silence Is the NBN on track to deliver its commitments and its rollout plans Point No 2 the government the n people and the opposition have now received this  of three eminent ns I would recommend that many members of the opposition who are catcalling now actually spend the time to read the Point No 1 six weeks ago the government was prepared to agree to Nauru in a compromise arrangement with the opposition Opposition Members Opposition members interjecting 8212 My question is to  Under John Howard s Pacific solution refugees were detained on Nauru for many years in some cases for as long as four years Under your new Pacific solution how long will refugees be Economics 101 natural monopoly 8212 look it up George In February the member for Wentworth said that he would hold the government to account on its promise of construction being underway or completed for 758 000 premises by the end I thank  for his  and ongoing interest in the NBN Last week I released NBN Co s 2012 15 corporate plan Important progress has been made by the government and NBN since the publication of the 2010 Opposition Senators Opposition senators interjecting 8212 Order The plan released last week is therefore NBN s first operational plan It confirmed that the NBN is a sound investment that will pay its own way and generate a 7 1 per cent return to the taxpayer Opposition senators Order I remind those on my left that shouting across the chamber is disorderly The minister is entitled to be heard in silence Order Continue Minister The plan demonstrates that the government is delivering on its commitment Its rollout is on target prices are coming down and you get a return to the taxpayer Time expired I thank the member for Melbourne for his question He is going to an aspect of the Houston panel s work which I know lots of people find very very challenging It has been the subject of discussion between members Order The member for Canning is warned I thank the member for Robertson for her question I know that she like all members of the government is concerned about the impact of electricity prices on family budgets and that she would hear very very routinely from the My question is  Will  update the House on the government s efforts to reform the electricity market and make sure ns get a fairer and better deal Mr President I ask a  Can the minister advise the Senate if he has any evidence that there is demand for the NBN Can the minister also advise if there is any evidence of demand for the speeds There is investment in infrastructure which is necessary because there is a backlog of investment There is growth in peak demand There are changes that have raised reliability standards and that have come at a high price and there is Opposition Senators Opposition senators interjecting 8212 Demand for the NBN is strong In just a year take up in Kiama has been 38 per cent and 35 per cent in Willunga The member for Wentworth s commitment in his speech last year at the Press Club Mr President I ask a further  Can the minister outline to the Senate any evidence he has that the NBN is a sound investment for our future Can the minister advise what the NBN means for the future I withdraw The member for Tangney cannot use that word and he is well aware of it The member for Tangney will  his seat I thank him for his assistance   I rise on a point of order on direct relevance  went to why she abolished offshore processing on Nauru four years ago What were the reasons Why did you do it The member for Cook will  his seat To the member s question the government then came to parliament to change  to enable offshore processing and we know that we faced a gridlock in this parliament We sought compromise We offered compromise and that compromise was not   I rise on a point of order The opposition continually stand in the guise of points of order and repeat s that are asked That is not a point of order and I ask you to The Leader of the House will  his seat and the member for Mackellar will  her seat I will not enter into these relentless points of order The standing orders have been changed to desist from  being The member who asked  who is a former minister for immigration and consequently has a great deal of experience in this policy area is aware that the government was elected to government with a set of policies about The member for Tangney will withdraw The government implemented those policies as the member is aware The government then determined that it was appropriate to have an approach of breaking the people smugglers business model through the agreement with Malaysia As the member is well aware Order  will  her seat  has the call and will be heard in silence Opposition Members Opposition members interjecting 8212 My question is to   why did the government abolish offshore processing on Nauru four years ago Mr President I ask a further  be placed on the Notice Paper The NBN as I have already said pays its own way It generates a return of 7 1 per cent But the benefits of the NBN are not just in its financial return to the government but in its return I rise to take note of answers given by Senator Evans to  asked by Senator Abetz I move That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Tertiary Education Skills Science and Research Senator Evans Mr  consistent with what was discussed during  I seek leave to table a letter from  to then Senator Bob Brown in relation to the mining tax

have a  to  Given that  has claimed that she was the substantive author of the policy that involved scrapping the Pacific solution will she now accept at least some responsibility for My question is to the Treasurer Will the Treasurer outline for the House what the recent jobs and economic data say about the strength of our economy I thank the member for Parramatta for her question because in recent weeks we have seen more evidence of the outstanding economic performance of the n economy and I know it is something that everybody on this side of the I just cannot believe that we are continuing to bicker over this issue before the Senate ns have had enough of this They have had a gutful of this issue and they simply want us to get on with it My question is to  I remind  of her statement Labor will end the so called Pacific solution 8230 because it is costly unsustainable and wrong as a matter of principle Given that her expert I counsel the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to study this  in detail What she will find when she studies this  in detail is that it is not saying to us Just exactly redo what was done in I present a copy of the communique from the 43rd Presiding Officers and Clerks Conference held in the Solomon Islands from 24 to 26 July 2012 From tomorrow it is proposed to commence a trial of captioning in the Federation Chamber Two screens

Leader of the House is not assisting by the last comment  is that the business of the day be called on Thanks  8212 that the contribution by Senator Cash on this matter was anything but dignified in fact I would have to say it was probably one of the most appalling contributions she has made to this Senate It is because she has Order on my left You are responsible Don t you understand responsibility and accountability Today is not a day about proclaiming political wins It is a day when all sides of politics have to stop the blame game the political point scoring and rise above all those arguments for the basis of humanity Senator I rise to take note of answers given by Senator Evans to  asked by Senator Abetz Labor has grown deaf and blind to the frustrations of ns regarding our borders  was a day that ns have grown tired Before proceeding I want to apologise to both the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Tangney I was probably a little hasty during  I was hoping

be submitted to the Senate for discussion The Gillard Government s pattern of broken promises raised I rise to speak on this matter of public importance which by its very nature indicates the necessity for discussion 8212 again the pattern of broken promises of this government the expectations that have been raised and dashed and the Is the amendment seconded I second the amendment I commence by thanking Minister Bowen for the opportunity to speak to him overnight and to meet with him this morning and for his making available the officials who have been working on the matter before us in the 24  now is that the amendment to the amendment be agreed to I am pleased to rise  to make a contribution to this debate on a matter of public importance When considering the subject of broken promises raised expectations and unfunded commitments there is no one better qualified than those In that fantastic contribution from Senator Feeney we saw the very point of the motion moved by Senator Fifield The modern day Labor Party is really only expert at one thing and that is in dissembling the English language and At the end of the last sitting period in this debate on what to do about asylum seekers and the recent upsurge in drownings off Christmas Island I stated that I was wrong 8212 wrong not to have previously supported I think that Senator Ryan s last statement should be looked at very carefully He said quite clearly that no matter how often you say things over and over again it gets to some degree of truth I am verballing ns will certainly be scratching their heads today in a combination of sadness and frustration More than four years after overturning the asylum seeker policies of the previous government Labor has outsourced its decision making responsibility to a panel After Senator Moore I hope that I contribute more than passionately delivered one liners to outline why the Gillard government s pattern of broken promises raised expectations and unfunded commitments is being debated today in the Senate I guess you have Another sitting day another ludicrous matter of public importance another waste of time and another own goal from the opposition The

2 shop I shall If you want to talk about cheap talk about your politics The cheapness we have to put up with today is listening to what comes from those opposite which means nothing We know that national policy settings alone cannot resolve We will do a bit better than that   8212 I think you will just withdraw unconditionally And I will ask him to withdraw I withdraw the whole statement But I will say that I think the gentleman that spoke to me was wrong because I do not think that there are any circumstances in which you could say the Leader of the Opposition I withdraw Mr Abbott I will say the Leader of the 8212 Don t be disgusting Absolutely I have read the  of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers from cover to cover I have had a look at what Mr Houston has said in his  and I have seen what has happened here It was I rise to speak on the same matter as my South n colleague Senator Birmingham I think it is extremely disappointing that we are at this point of the review into the Murray Darling Basin Plan 8212 draft after draft Over the last two days we have witnessed the public humiliation of a government that is too arrogant too stubborn and too stupid to acknowledge its abject policy failures and to admit that it was wrong 8212 dreadfully manifestly and There is no bigger issue in South  than the issue of water and water security and the health of the Murray Darling Basin so I note the minister s very cute response to the Senate resolution It would be I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the response by the Attorney General Ms Roxon to a resolution of the

Movement of refugee and migrant populations throughout the Asia Pacific is not a new or insubstantial issue The Asia Pacific region currently has 3 6 million refugees accounting for 24 per cent of the world s refugee population The migration I know what you said Senator but my understanding is that in substance the test is the same I ve just quoted 8212 That is just not true Based on the information I have been provided by the very competent people who have been dealing with this issue in the lower House and who are now advising me in the Senate The suggestion in your amendment is that Based on your thorough reading of the review No kidding I hate to disappoint Senator Cormann but the government is not prepared to 8212 No kidding Senator Cormann The government does not believe that this is an appropriate amendment We reject the suggestion that the scale test that this  applies is different from the one recommended by the Cooper review We will have to agree to disagree Senator Cormann because my understanding 8212 and the information I have been given in respect of this 8212 is that in substance the test 8212 That s exactly what I m suggesting We reject that This bill and this particular part of the  is not about bigger is always better There is no dollar value that creates an impediment to new superannuation funds does not impose a minimum size I rise this

third time I move That this bill be now read a third time I welcome this opportunity to speak on the Migration  Amendment Offshore Processing and Other Measures Bill 2011 and these changes and in overall terms this government s policies It is certainly not the first time I have spoken on Mr  I rise on a point of order on relevance My point of order is that the discussion that Senator Joyce has now entered into has absolutely nothing to do with before the chamber which is It is a shame that Senator McLucas does not understand what we are talking about because we currently have a case of drug resistant tuberculosis present in the Cairns Base Hospital but of course she would not know about that I rise to speak on the Aviation Transport Security Amendment Screening Bill 2012 This is yet another example of a positive agenda where the coalition and the government can come to an agreement on something that is definitely to the You don t know what you re talking about Thank you very much Mr  I was pointing out the costs that we have for this measure It is pertinent to understand comparative costs and where the government has its priorities The overall cost of the NBN when Senator Joyce I will remind you of that is before the chair at the moment I move coalition amendment 1 in relation to trustee obligations Schedule 1 item 9 page 6 lines 1 to 20 omit paragraphs 29VN b and c The coalition s amendment would remove section 29VN b and c of I rise tonight to speak to the Migration  Amendment Offshore Processing and Other Measures Bill 2011 It is with some relief that I see common sense finally prevailing on the other side in relation to this bill None of This bill paves the way for compulsory full body scanners to be introduced in major n airports It could also pave the way for longer queues at our airports because the responsible minister Mr Albanese has failed to address many I rise to speak to the Senate tonight about iron Much is said about the mining of iron ore in  Iron and steel play an enormous part in our lives every day And we know that there is iron I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate on the Migration  Amendment Offshore Processing

issue which is of huge significance and that is the supermarket duopoly strangling n grocery market competition and the impact of that on consumers It is interesting to note that Senator Kim Carr It is with great pleasure that I rise here this evening to speak on this issue and more so because I am following the member for Berowra and his magnificent contribution Quite frankly there would be few in this place I have been fortunate to be involved in community volunteering for most of my life When I was 13 years old I joined the Maroubra Surf Lifesaving Club and I remain an active member of the

the defence of  In 2006 the 2 40th s historian Peter Henning said Order The time allotted for this debate has expired Debate interrupted I was actually shocked I told my staff He ll keep talking as he usually does I think it is a first for Senator Mason isn t it not to use his full 20 minutes The Cybercrime  Amendment Bill It is Thank you  Acting  I am surprised that Senator Mason did not use his full 20 minutes It is quite uncharacteristic of him  Acting  you might recall that last night in the chamber I spoke about the life and work of Gore Vidal who died on 31 July this year at the age of 86 Despite being a prolific novelist I am really pleased that we have had a number of school groups listening from the public galleries today and one group has just moved on because they heard and witnessed firsthand the absolute hypocrisy of those on the other The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations has provided the following answer to the honourable senator s question Minister Shorten is on the public record as at 26 April 2012 as having not seen Ms Asmar for about a year asked the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations upon notice on 25

Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations upon notice on 6 August 2012 With reference to the Budget estimates hearings of the Education Employment and Workplace Relations  Committee in May 2012 and the answers to 15 05 I move That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation Senator Wong and the Minister for Agriculture Fisheries and Forestry Senator Ludwig to  without notice asked by Senators Birmingham The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations has provided the following answer to the honourable senator s question Yes The issue of which other Minister s were involved has been dealt with in public statements by Minister Evans and Minister asked the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations upon notice on 25 June 2012 With reference to the grounding of the Qantas fleet in October 2011 was the Minister privy to the teleconference of ministers that determined The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations has provided the following answer to the honourable senator 8217 s question The Department of Education Employment and Workplace Relations and my office give all parliamentary  the expected level of attention required asked the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations upon notice on 25 June 2012 With reference to the unanswered  on notice nos 1558 1761 1809 and 1814 1 Why does each question on notice remain unanswered I present a supplementary explanatory memorandum to and move the government amendment 1 160 160 160 Schedule 1 page 3 line 1 to page 13 line 21 omit the Schedule substitute Schedule 1 8212 Reform of living away In closing  Temporary Chair 8212 and then I will ask you to put  if there are no other contributions 8212 the Greens agree with Human Rights Watch who state should explicitly ban investment because it I would like to thank the member for Fremantle and all of the speakers on this bill It is an important piece of  and I think it is a measure of the interest in the House and in the I move That government business order of the day no 3 Corporations  Amendment Financial ing Panel Bill 2012 be postponed till the next day of sitting Question agreed to Last night I put on notice by way of  to the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence and or the department a fairly large amount of material I am wondering at the outset whether the minister can provide us with any I think no is the easiest answer There is some publicly available material that I have looked at but in terms of a formal response to  on notice we do not have an answer for you this morning The answer is no 8212 we do not yet have it Nothing That makes it difficult to proceed One of the things I was after 8212 probably the most important 8212 concerned the references I provided last night I do not understand why this would not have been forthcoming during the morning I have looked at advice given by the Congressional Research Service to the US Congress on 27 June 2012 and that may very well be a  Senator Ludlam is familiar with In any event it uses statistics that are I thank the minister 8212 he has left himself some wriggle room in case figures come back that are different The other question of great consequence that I put to him last night was whether I am correct in assuming I do not really have much to add to where we got to in the debate last night Senator Ludlam I will repeat the position we reached The events in 2003 occurred well before the convention so obviously  at I indicate to senators that we are still asking general  about as was Senator Xenophon last night I want to move us through and get to our amendments We will return to this issue briefly when I Firstly I repeat that there are no US bases in  There are joint facilities I asked you not to do that I am resisting the temptation to head down that road too Senator Ludlam I also make clear that  has never had stockpiles of these weapons I know you understand that Senator Ludlam but it is important to put it I suspect this is slightly unorthodox but as we have representatives of the coalition here  8212 you might want to seek some advice from your shadow spokesperson 8212 I invite the coalition to establish what their policy is I am sure that our relevant shadow and his office are tuned in at the moment and that when they are next in the chamber they will oblige you Thank you for that Yes 8212 who would want to miss it How could you possibly not be watching Minister why has it been decided to embed this commitment as a policy undertaking rather than simply write it into the Because is designed to give effect to the Convention on Cluster Munitions and so keeps faith with the convention What we are now talking about is  of policy that goes above and beyond the Minister Feeney Austria has stated 8230 foreign stockpiling of cluster munitions on the national territory of States Parties is prohibited by the Convention 8230 Should a State Party to the Convention allow a foreign state to stockpile cluster munitions on So the minister has not endorsed the Austrian position Austria has taken that position Obviously it is utterly entitled to take that position I can only repeat the n government s view which is that we have introduced  into this parliament that keeps faith with the convention and No That is extremely concerning Colombia noted The government absolutely rejects 8230 any manner of 8230 storage of foreign cluster bombs in Colombian territory 8230 Guatemala wrote that it considered 8230 the stockpiling of cluster munitions of other countries in the It is not a loophole Senator Ludlam This is a piece of  that keeps faith with the convention and encompasses the interoperability provisions that we need as a matter of practical application to our alliance with the United States Minister the operative part of that I am referring to section 72 42 states as you are  aware Section 72 38 8212 which is the fairly comprehensive list of things that are prohibited 8212 does not The government do not support deleting section 72 42 We say that the effect of deleting section 72 42 would be that visiting military personnel of countries who are not party to the convention would be prohibited from any conduct I am happy to cede the call to Senator Birmingham because I know he wanted to be here for the debate last night and I have put  through your duty senator inquiring into coalition policy which I know This is not about flexibility it is about this bill achieving its purpose its intent 8212 that is supporting the convention and meeting the requirements of the convention We think it is entirely appropriate and that indeed the most effective I had hoped to make a contribution on this bill during the  debate but unfortunately was unable to do so due to conflicting commitments I do not propose to give a speech here on the  and I take up the invitation Senator Birmingham I repeat that the government thanks the opposition for supporting the Criminal Code Amendment Cluster Munitions Prohibition Bill 2010 I guess that the opposition has reached the judgement as have we that this I thank the parliamentary secretary I certainly will return to the Hansard from last night Can the parliamentary secretary please explain to me what form the public statement he is referring to will take Is there an example that you When this instrument has been ratified and lodged the n government will make a public statement and that public statement will be in line with the undertakings I have given this chamber Thereafter itself requires that there be Yes that conforms with my understanding I thank the minister and I certainly understand in relation to the annual transparency  the commitment being made by the government Essentially the public statement could be the form of a ministerial statement to the House it could be The minister has used the term authorisation of weapons being stockpiled or transited through  I also thank Senator Birmingham I guess we can only hope that in the unlikely event that there is a change of government next year Firstly there is nothing hypothetical about our policy Our policy is our policy and it is plain The government strictly monitors the presence of cluster munitions and other explosives on n territory Ships and aircraft owned by foreign armed forces I thank the minister Does that not apply to nuclear weapons Is that simply a blank box or is that information provided to the n government but just not then provided to people We are now creeping outside the scope of this debate Let me say in a very off the cuff way that as I comprehend it what I have just described is how  deals with munitions not nuclear weapons There To come back to the topic of cluster weapons then correct me if I am wrong but we are given an inventory of the total amount of ordnance but not broken out by weapon type so we would not necessarily I think your understanding of that is correct We will not be aware of cluster munitions that are aboard foreign planes or vessels transiting through  but we are required to be and we are aware of all munitions stockpiled I thank the minister for that I think it is still remarkably unsatisfactory Nothing that the minister has said 8212 and I know you are being as helpful as you can Minister 8212 has given me any comfort whatsoever as Minister in the instance of an aircraft that was not passing through n airspace but was in fact parked at Tindal in the NT for a period of three or four months and the aircraft had these weapons on board The circumstance of that individual aircraft would be taken on a case by case basis and it would be dealt with by the government on the basis that we prohibit the stockpiling of cluster munitions in  We are in your hands Senator Ludlam as to how we handle the amendments The only thing is that the last of your amendments No 6 needs to be moved separately I will speak to each of them in turn I now move amendment 1 on sheet 7084 which relates to intention 1 160 160 160 Schedule 1 item 1 page 3 line 28 omit paragraph 72 38 2 c substitute The government s position is that we agree with your understanding that the proposed amendment is intended to alter the standard of fault which applies to an element of the offence of assisting encouraging or inducing the commission of a It is actually very straightforward Again I think we are retracing ground that I covered last night Clearly the government has supported this convention as indeed has the opposition and the Greens because we are all committed to the eradication The minister may find it mundane that a party to the convention would be doing the bidding of a party not to the convention that actively deploys and uses in military conflicts these weapons So as for developing a common  is that the amendment moved by Senator Ludlam to schedule 1 item 1 paragraph 72 38 2 c be agreed to Question negatived I think the chamber should have reconsidered that one However I will move to Greens amendment 2 on sheet 7084 2 Schedule 1 item 1 page 3 after line 29 after subsection 72 38 2 insert 2A 160 160 160 No I am afraid Senator the government does not support the proposed amendment The government repeats its view that this bill gives full effect to the convention 8212 the convention that represents the agreement of the international community on prohibiting So when I finally move this motion the Senate will be voting to keep a loophole open that the financial community wants closed 8212 just so that we are well aware that A number of countries have  which directly I am not sure it is the intention of standing orders to facilitate questioning of the opposition in the course of the committee stage of the debate on a bill but I will oblige without setting a precedent and indicate I am happy to respond Senator Each signatory to the convention is implementing its obligations under the convention in accordance with its domestic processes and requirements Some countries 8212 for example Guatemala Lebanon Madagascar Malawi Malta Rwanda and Zambia 8212 Minister if I can put my question to you directly if I invest in company A which does not manufacture cluster weapons but which does have a holding in company B which does manufacture cluster weapons am I in breach gives effect to the convention in n law and is guided and limited by the convention provides that a person or entity commits an offence if they intentionally assist encourage or induce a person or entity  is that Greens amendment 2 to insert subsection 2A into 72 38 2 in schedule 1 item 1 be agreed to So I can invest in a shell company that does not manufacture cluster weapons but owns entities that do and the minister somehow wants us to believe that that is in keeping with the spirit of the convention It is It would really be of no assistance and indeed might even be entirely counterproductive for me to try and provide advice around a scenario like that There are battalions of folk who are better equipped to manage those sorts of I suspect that this will be among the least controversial of the amendments that the Greens have proposed to this bill and it is also one with which I have the least issue This is simply a technical amendment The The government does not support the proposed amendment as we believe it is not necessary to include this requirement in the  Article 9 of the convention allows state parties to take legal administrative or other measures to implement the I commend this amendment to the chamber The CHAIRMAN  is that amendment 3 on sheet 7084 moved by Senator Ludlam be agreed to Question negatived The CHAIRMAN Senator Ludlam do you wish to proceed with amendment 4 Chair Senator Ludlam the government does not support this proposed amendment and again we say that it is not necessary to include this requirement in  Article 9 of the convention allows state parties to implement the convention through legal administrative I move amendment 5 5 160 160 160 Schedule 1 item 1 page 6 lines 7 to 31 omit section 72 41 substitute 72 41 Defence 8212 participation by ns in military cooperation with countries not party to Convention on As I said Senator as we commenced today those are issues on which I have undertaken to get back to you We have taken those  on notice Of course I guess a nuanced but important one is that we Chair I seek your guidance as the clock runs down as to whether you want to take us straight into  I strongly dispute the statement that the minister has just made and will persist with this amendment when Before proceeding to  without notice I draw the attention of honourable senators to the presence in the chamber of a parliamentary delegation from the Solomon Islands led by  Gordon Darcy Lilo On behalf of all senators My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency Senator Wong I refer the minister to her answer to  from Senator Cormann  in which she compared carbon pricing in Europe with The Manager of Opposition Business will  his seat  has the call and will refer to  before the chair I know there is a lot of sookiness with the blokes on that side who do not like any scrutiny of their policy failure Every time we mention the fact that their policy will cost more they want to jump Thank you very much   There are no number of points of order no measure of reinterpretation of  that gets away from the single fact at the heart of this there is bipartisan support in this Order I do draw the minister s attention to  The minister has one minute 20 seconds remaining Mr President I raise a point of order on relevance  is does the minister accept in per person terms that  s carbon tax is at least nine times bigger than Europe s ETS That is    I rise on a point of order  is talking about since the election  was will she apologise for breaching her promise before the last election I certainly accept that the most expensive climate policy on offer is that which Senator Joyce supports which is 1 300 per household every year 8212 1 300 every year in more tax as a result of the cost of I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question 8212 breathtaking in its originality I could not possibly have predicted that This is the second anniversary of the election in 2010 and since the two years passed we have My question is to  I remind  that this is the second anniversary of the last election With the next election less than 12 months away when will  swallow her pride admit I am still reeling I think it is relevant to get the facts on the table You obviously disagree I think it is relevant to get the facts on the table about the prices that are part of your policy   I ask a  If  is to be believed why didn t she have the decency before the election to stand up before the people and say there will be a carbon tax Mr President I ask a  Why does the minister persist in comparing Labor s carbon tax with countries that generate most of their electricity from renewable hydro sources For instance  she compared us to Norway which gets In the 2010 election campaign we spoke to the n people about the need for an emissions trading scheme We will get to that emissions trading scheme 8212 admittedly not in a way that I predicted but we will get I think the  is above being bullied I am not going to ask the member for Indi to withdraw but if I do hear it again I will  has the call As I did not hear the member for Indi s interjection 8212 Government members We did I am the chair I am sure everybody else would love the job If you want to come on down it is quite a I would ask the member for Indi to withdraw her interjection The Manager of Opposition Business will  his seat The Leader of the House Mrs Mirabella interjecting 8212 I have a further  Mr President I refer to the fact that the regional greenhouse gas initiative in the United States has just raised 6 per person for the year The New Zealand government has forecast carbon revenues   I rise on a point of order  was asked a very simple question why didn t she tell the truth before the last election To the Leader of the Opposition who raises once again the matters that he has been on for two years like a broken record here he goes The Leader of the Opposition well knows that Labor stood in 2007 for  you nailed it in one with that prediction That was indeed the statement made by the member for Indi and she should withdraw I certainly cannot name a country that has a price of 1 300 per household for every year for a decade but that is what we have got on offer over there 8212 1 300 per household for every year Mr President on a point of order on relevance I have directly asked  can the minister name any country in the world that is going to pay more than 340 per person per year I can understand why Order That is now debating it There is  of order The minister has 27 seconds remaining I do not accept  s figures If he wants to go down the per capita route then he would know that we are also the highest per capita emitter of any advanced economy in the world I would My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs Senator Bob Carr Can the minister update the Senate on the progress of the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands I wish to acknowledge the distinguished presence in the chamber of  of the Solomon Islands the Hon Gordon Darcy Lilo and his delegation We are honoured to have  visit  as a guest of Order I draw to the attention of honourable senators the presence in the chamber of a parliamentary delegation from the United Kingdom led by the Right Honourable the Lord Grocott MP On behalf of all senators I wish you a Can  confirm that before the last election she said on at least half a dozen occasions that there would be no carbon price until there was a deep and lasting consensus Again I ask  I inform the House that we have present in the gallery today the Minister of Immigration from the New Zealand parliament the Hon Nathan Guy and I would like to welcome him to the chamber  Honourable members Hear  8212 The Manager of Opposition Business will  his seat He should be aware in his capacity that there are the forms of the House and for continual abuse of points of order action will be taken  has The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will  her seat  has the call That builds on the Leader of the Opposition saying  that the current level of funding for public schools is an injustice 8212 that is that they should get less A plan for cuts a plan for no increases 8212 I know many find quoting the Leader of the Opposition offensive but he did say injustice and by that he meant cutbacks for public schools 8212 Time expired  on a point of order I find it offensive and disorderly for  to continue to make false accusations about the coalition s policies for funding for public schools Under standing order 92 where a member The Manager of Opposition Business who has just raised the point of order said today The current level of funding for independent schools and government schools is appropriate That is there is no need for more  the Leader of This parliament supported carbon pricing and the Leader of the Opposition would have voted for it if he was true to his real beliefs The Manager of Opposition Business will  his seat There was  of order  has the call  on a point of order as the coalition is the only party supporting more money for public schools 8212 I thank the member for Greenway for her question We have been working hard over two years to make sure we keep the n economy strong We have been working hard so that ns have got the benefit of jobs My question is to  Will  update the House on the major reforms the government is undertaking to improve our schools our economy and our community Mr President I ask a  Can the minister advise the Senate of RAMSI s transition  has been proud to lead RAMSI It has been a great regional endeavour All Pacific Islands Forum countries have contributed personnel and shared its success Based on the firm foundations of its achievements RAMSI is now in transition In Mr President I ask a further  Can the minister advise the Senate of the future focus of  s aid program to the Solomon Islands Our development partnership with the Solomon Islands is strong Over 2012 to 2013  s aid to the Solomon Islands will firstly help over 150 000 children stay at school by supporting tuition free basic education secondly will improve access Thank you Mr President It says they are facing a 30 000 to 50 000 increase in their electricity  partly as a result of the carbon tax and that as result they may need to axe or reduce their Government Senators Government senators interjecting 8212 Order Can we leave the football season alone Senator Birmingham My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency Senator Wong I refer the minister to s in our hometown paper the Adelaide Advertiser that indicate local footy clubs are facing a 30 000 That s not my care that one 8212 To the member s question as I have indicated in this parliament on more than one occasion I am concerned about businesses that are suffering with high electricity prices with the 50 60 and 70 per cent we have seen I refer  to the fact that HM Gem Engines a 50 year old business based in Dandenong is facing an increased electricity bill of 150 000 a year because of the carbon tax and to the statement Order Senator Wong is entitled to be heard in silence Sorry I can listen to you My question is to  I refer  to the fact that HM Gem Engines a 50 year old business based in Dandenong is facing 8212 Ms Gillard interjecting 8212 Would you like me to pause   I rise on a point of order It was actually about breaking the promise There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead and whether  will 8212 Can I take this opportunity to congratulate Senator Birmingham on his appearance on Q amp A for the first time last night I have to say judging from 8212 Senator Wong come to question I will come to  I just thought that the chamber should be aware that I think he did very well I suspect however from the tweets that Senator Cameron might have bested him I am very happy to Order Ignore the interjection Senator Wong But Mr President it is so tempting It might be tempting but address the chair and address  Through you Mr President as I said it is misleading 8212 Opposition senators interjecting 8212 It is misleading to attribute the entire price rise to the carbon price I would point out two things One is that the Treasury modelling did estimate the impact of the carbon price on sport and recreation at about 0 The member for Dunkley The member for Canning may bring on a cup of tea very shortly if he is not careful As the member well knows as someone who stood in the 2007 election he has been in favour of carbon pricing Let me quote his exact words He said It was actually the coalition that instigated work on the emissions The member for Dunkley will  his seat  is answering   has the call Mr President I ask a  I refer the minister to s from last week also in the Advertiser that indicate the Belair Hotel has faced a 45 per cent jump in the off peak component of its monthly I thank the member for Deakin for his question because in his schools he is already seeing the benefit of this government s investment in education There are about 40 schools there that have had an investment of around 78 My question is to the Minister for School Education and Minister for Early Childhood and Youth Will the minister update the House on the development of the government s plans to improve all n schools This question was asked last week by the member for Boothby and a number of us know the Belair Hotel reasonably well I think Senator McEwen might know it pretty well to be honest with you she still lives up We on this side of the House could not agree more and that is why we will continue with these significant and important education reforms Opposition members interjecting 8212 Mr Albanese interjecting 8212 Mr Martin Ferguson interjecting 8212 Government members You re all froth and no beer The member for Sturt have been based on the need of these students Our approach to national school improvement will be the same The Leader of the Opposition does not agree He sees injustice in the way independent schools are funded but how he Where s the government s response and endorsed by many in the community Interestingly enough it was endorsed I saw by the member for Calare who on his website was kind enough to observe There is widespread acknowledgement that every child should have access to the Well get on with it then The member for Sturt is warned Order The Leader of the House the minister for resources and other government members the member for Dickson has the call and will be heard in silence Mr President I ask a further  Given the minister has failed despite all of Labor s rhetoric about carbon tax compensation to identify one piece of assistance given to local footy clubs other clubs generally or pubs in I do not agree with the premise of  and that was not the answer I gave The difficulty is that Senator Birmingham is writing s before he hears the answers and is writing s with complete Thank you very much for  Senator Wright The government has made it very clear that all schools in  8212 nearly 10 000 of them 8212 will receive extra funding whether they be Catholic schools whether they be My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for School Education Early Childhood and Youth   told the independent schools association that all independent schools would receive an increase in funding under the government s plans I refer  to Ben Turner who runs a small business employing five people in my electorate Ben s latest power bill has skyrocketed to 2 000 with a 25 per cent increase to his retail electricity charges My question is to  Oh come on Order I did warn the Leader of the House I rise on a point of order Ben s business cannot afford to pass these costs on His electricity bill is 2 000 He is getting no compensation and  should be 8212 Mr President I ask a  Thank you for your answer Minister The Gonski recommendations are about improving our education system They are designed to provide every child in  with the best educational opportunities irrespective of their background The member for Dickson will  his seat  has the call and will refer to  before the chair Opposition Members Opposition members interjecting 8212 No amount of shrieking and screaming from the opposition changes that fact Of course we see the opposition so desperate to continue their negative campaign that there is no fact they will not deny if it gets in the way I thank the member for his question As I have said in answer to a large number of  small businesses do not directly pay the carbon price That is paid by the nation s biggest polluters Thank you very much For small business owners like Ben and for business owners around the nation we want to see our national economy modern transformed ready to seize the opportunities of the future A clean energy future is a Labor have always believed that education is very very important Our critical priority in government has been investment in education We are committed to ensuring that every child in this country gets a fair go Public education in this country Mr President I ask a further  The opposition spokesperson on education the member for Sturt Christopher Pyne is quoted today as saying the opposition will increase funding to all schools The opposition has previously announced proposed cuts to My question is to the Treasurer Treasurer comprehensive tax reform advocates like New South Wales Treasurer Mike Baird Ken Henry and myself and many other MPs have been repeatedly making the point that only 10 taxes in  do 90 Just before I call the member I want to recognise in the gallery today a group of n Union of Jewish Students and welcome them to the chamber today Honourable members Hear hear The opposition plan to cut funding for schools and on the latest count it will be by 2 8 billion You are correct in that number Senator Wright We have heard a lot about their attitudes to teachers We have I thank the member for Lyne for his very important question It goes to the heart of the sustainability of our tax system and the future prosperity of our economy This government has already delivered three rounds of personal income My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency Senator Wong I refer the minister to s that Pete s Fish Farm a rainbow trout producer in Kalangadoo in the south east of her Order When there is silence we will proceed Senator Wong I do not have personal knowledge of the fish farm at Kalangadoo to which  refers but I suspect my response on this issue would be the same as it has been on every other 8212 I do not have personal knowledge of Pete s Fish Farm at Kalangadoo Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting 8212 Senator Bernardi interjecting 8212 There is an echo at the end of the chamber Honourable senators interjecting 8212 You couldn t care less Senator Ryan interjecting 8212 They could answer their own  Yes we could just allow Senator Macdonald to answer I suppose It could be an interesting conversation between him and Senator Edwards Senator Wong ignore the interjections I suspect my answer on this would be the same as on other issues The first point is on materiality You have to be careful in suggesting that the entirety of an electricity price increase is as a result of Mr President I ask a  of the minister On the point of materiality of entirety as the minister coins it I refer the minister to the fact that the owner of Pete s Fish Farm described the carbon Treasurer if I have read your answer correctly you are accepting the point that it is your job to increase the use of efficient taxes and decrease the use of the inefficient ones Can you name an inefficient tax you   on a point of order the Independents are entitled to one  each week I point out to you that the member for Denison had one  and therefore it is not in order for the The issue of supplementaries has not been bedded down in the standing orders 8212 it is by agreement I will allow the supplementary I think it was last week that the member for Denison asked a supplementary It was last The government does understand the circumstances of many of  s small businesses which is why we wanted to provide a tax cut to them which was opposed by those opposite That is why we put in place an instant I am certainly looking forward to the recommendations which will come forward from the state Treasurers when it comes to their inefficient state taxes 8212 certainly that is a process which is in place What we have put in place   on a point of order I am endeavouring to help my colleague and friend the member for Lyne who asked the Treasurer to be relevant Name one inefficient tax that you have abolished Very simply the write off rules which apply to capital items purchased by small businesses have been replaced by the 6 500 instant asset write off pumping 1 billion into the economy to increase the cash flow of small business The member for North Sydney will  his seat Points of order are not opportunities for debate The Treasurer has the call Mr President I ask a final  Given the carbon tax will make margins for small businesses even lower resulting in many business owners walking away from the businesses they run and the people they employ how many more I suggest that with the words of that question  has demonstrated the confected outrage from a bloke who is part of a party that have said We re not going to pass on a company tax cut with I am not trivialising it The member for Reid will  his seat My apologies to the member for Reid The Manager of Opposition Business will  his seat I am not trivialising this I am making a point that   with the greatest respect to you I ask you to reflect in future on ejecting members from the House who are responding to disorderly conduct from the government ministers and  8212 The Manager of Opposition Business will  his seat The Manager of Opposition Business is aware there are other forms of the House Interjecting calling out and not observing the standing orders is not one of them There are other Thank you Opposition members interjecting 8212 The Manager of Opposition Business will  his seat Mr Melham interjecting 8212 The member for Banks has form as well The Manager of Opposition Business is aware there are other forms of the House in which he can pursue   I rise on a point of order Before we take the next question I ask you under standing order 90 how could it not be an imputation of improper motives to suggest things of the opposition members It is very simple We on this side of the House understand the importance of investment in schools when it comes to productivity and opportunity in our society They do have a plan to slash public funding of schools and The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will  her seat I would advise that standing orders do not take provocation into consideration The Treasurer has the call   on a point of order  we saw some scenes in this parliament that some would say appeared disorderly If the Treasurer continues to make untrue statements and perpetuate falsities it leads to disorderly conduct in the Everybody in this House knows that there is a 70 billion crater in the budget bottom line of the Liberal and National parties because the shadow Treasurer said so on breakfast television We know that they have a secret plan The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will  her seat The Treasurer has the call I too have  for the Treasurer Will the Treasurer outline for the House the importance of delivering the big reforms like improving our schools investing in infrastructure and putting a price on carbon based on hard facts and I thank the member for Reid for that question The reforms of the past have helped deliver the prosperity that we have today and the reforms of today will help deliver the prosperity of tomorrow That is why for example   on a point of order how could it be directly relevant for the Treasurer to talk about something the government has not done   on a point of order under standing order 92 b I find it offensive and disorderly for the Treasurer to continue to make false accusations and perpetuate falsity about the coalition s policy The Manager of Opposition will  his seat Continual abuse of points of order will not be tolerated The Treasurer has the call he is being relevant to  We know that the opposition does not support investing in better schools We know that the Leader of the Opposition wants to get the axe out and axe funding for public schools That is what he meant  when he My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for School Education Early Childhood and Youth Senator Kim Carr Can the minister inform the Senate of the nature of the government s investments in  s public schools Sure when Senator Brandis lines up the support for Mr Abbott s cuts to public education he will recognise that 85 per cent of Indigenous children attend public schools 83 per cent of children from remote and regional areas attend Order Senator Carr you will refer to another senator by their correct title Tell us about the class war and the hit list Lord Brandis you ought to know something about class war when it comes to education I thank  for her question and I acknowledge her longstanding expertise in education The government is very proud of the money it has invested in schools whether they be public private or catholic As I have already indicated Mr President I ask a  How does the government respond to concerns that students in public schools get more than their fair share Mr Abbott said  So there is no question of injustice to public schools here If anything the injustice is the other way He made the statement that we are in fact providing an injustice when we talk about public The Labor point of view is that there can be no higher priority than spending on education This is the basic premise on which we operate What we say is you do not take money off the poor to give Mr President I have a  Is the government confident that its investments can be justified in the context of a tough fiscal climate My question is to the Minister for Agriculture Fisheries and Forestry Senator Ludwig Can the minister confirm that the Indonesian government has effectively halved the quota for both live cattle and boxed beef exported from  over the last 12 I thank Senator Back for his question Can I say that  has a strong relationship with Indonesia and our governments continue to work together In July I travelled to Darwin to take part in a meeting with the Indonesian   I ask a  The Treasurer has just spoken about the importance of getting the facts right when talking about the impacts of carbon pricing Treasurer are there any examples that show what happens when the The Treasurer has the call and I am seeking his assistance not to provoke the opposition too much We said that carbon pricing will have a modest impact on prices in our economy The Treasury modelling shows that the price impact would be 0 7 per cent 8212 less than one cent in the dollar That is why The member for Wright is not amusing My question is to  I refer  to the fact that the Lakes Entrance Fishermen s Co operative in my electorate is facing an increase in its power bill of 24 000 this year because Mr President I have a  Is the minister aware of s that Indonesian government ministers have stated they now intend to import beef and buffalo meat from so called foot and mouth disease free zones in affected countries Opposition Senators Opposition senators interjecting 8212 The n live export trade to Indonesia and other markets continues to support jobs families and communities right across regional  The government s reforms place animal welfare at the heart of the live export trade This new system does I thank Senator Back for his continued scare campaign across these areas The n live 8212 To the member who asked  we have just seen the Treasurer deal with the so called facts from   and clearly what the opposition said then was wrong so of course I will check what the It is a long way away and still there That is my point It is a long way away and still there despite what has been claimed about carbon pricing We always said to small businesses like the one the On a point of order of relevance   Whyalla is a long way from Lakes Entrance  I would like you to refer to Lakes Entrance Fishermen s Co operative  will  her seat Order on  Mr President I have a second  This is a secure supply chain Will the minister confirm that Indian buffalo meat is being packaged and labelled as product of  then sold illegally into Indonesia and that the catalyst Again Senator Back wants to dwell on a scare campaign If he has any evidence of this then he should provide it to the relevant authorities What is important to recognise is that this government continues to support the live My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Sustainability Environment Water Population and Communities Senator Conroy Last night s Four Corners program highlighted the plight of our national icon the koala It showed how tragically koala populations in Honourable Senators Honourable senators interjecting 8212 Last night s program showed how koala populations in New South Wales and Queensland are crashing threatened by climate change disease dogs and rampant land clearing from both urban development and mining In April this year Minister Burke gained the Order on my right and on my left Senator Conroy is entitled to hear  and Senator Waters is entitled to be heard The member for Dawson is warned I seek leave to table the statement from the general manager of the Lakes Entrance Fishermen s Co operative where he makes the point We don t have the luxury to pass the costs on to consumers Leave not granted I inform the House that we have present in the gallery  members of a parliamentary delegation from the United Kingdom On behalf of the House I extend a very warm welcome to the delegation Honourable members Hear Hear My question is to the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and Minister for Industry and Innovation Will the minister update the House on international efforts to tackle dangerous climate change How does  compare with the rest of Order on  Senator Waters is entitled to hear the answer When there is silence we will proceed I thank  for her question The Gillard government is committed to the protection and recovery of the koala one of  s iconic species Koalas hold a special place in our community That is why we have taken Honourable Senators Honourable senators interjecting 8212 That is why we have taken action to help protect the koala for future generations by listing it as a vulnerable species under national environmental law The Queensland New South Wales and ACT koala populations continue to be under serious Order I repeat again Senator Waters is entitled to hear the answer These populations have been listed as a vulnerable species This listing gives the koala an extra layer of protection The koala is as I have said a national icon and national protection provides for consistent treatment of the koala under The member for Mackellar is warned I thank  the member for Banks for his question because today the Climate Commission has released a new and independent assessment of international action on climate change It concludes that every major economy is tackling climate change No The meat industry does have a lot of opportunities under the carbon pricing arrangements to improve its efficiency its productivity and its competitiveness With simple technology 8212 for example by covering a settlement pond at a meatworks 8212 methane gas I thank the minister for his answer I ask a  The koala has been estimated to contribute over 1 billion annually in tourism dollars Minister Burke said last night that state processes were sending koalas on a path   I ask a  Minister in your answer you mentioned the meat industry Can you outline for the House what opportunities the carbon price creates for the meat industry Minister Burke said that that was why we had environmental regulation So what does the minister say to tourism operators about the now ditching its new responsibilities to look after koalas and leaving their survival to the whim Order Continue Senator Waters Honourable Senators Honourable senators interjecting 8212 Mr President I ask a further  Why is the government so eager to abandon its responsibility to protect our nationally significant environmental matters like koalas other threatened species migratory species National Heritage places and Ramsar wetlands How given As I said I and this government fundamentally reject the assertions that are the premise of that question It is not true I have just outlined on behalf of Minister Burke a whole range of protections and made the absolute We reject the premise of that assertion This government is serious about maintaining environmental standards including for the koala and its habitat The Gillard government has committed 300 000 of new funding under the National Environmental Research Program to find My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations Senator Ludwig I refer to s that Dean Mighell boss of the ETU a significant donor to the n Labor Party and to the n Greens Certainly there are opportunities for people in the meat industry I refer the member to them We are determined to cut carbon pollution We know that the Leader of the Opposition supports putting a price on carbon and that he The Leader of the House will  his seat  has the call She was asked a specific question and I would draw her back to  before the chair   on a point of order if you do not believe in the science then you do not believe in pricing carbon and that is why it is relevant He has just explained the circumstances of the meat industry and some of the opportunities there are for people in the meat industry because of the way we put a price on carbon and because of the way the programs  will return to  The Manager of Opposition Business will  his seat  will return to  The member for Flynn will  his seat  has just commenced her answer  has the call My question is  I refer  to a statement of Tom Maguire of Teys meatworks 8212 a company on the carbon tax hit list 8212 in my electorate Mr Maguire said We could close this To the member s question first and foremost I would refer him to the answer just given by the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency who has explained very clearly and in great detail the circumstances of the meat It is not a broad question at all Mr President The PRESIDENT I am listening closely to the answer Senator Abetz I do not believe there is a point of order at this stage  was about the ETU 8212 Senator Kim Carr interjecting 8212 and  was whether or not Fair Work  was investigating the matter to which Senator Bushby referred in his question Order Senator Abetz on a point of order I thank Senator Bushby for his question In terms of the Victorian Electrical Trades Union allegations under this government the regulation of registered organisations and financial service providers has never been stronger We have recently amended the Fair Work Registered It is a broad question What I was going to go on to say before Senator Abetz provided his lack of knowledge across industrial relations is that FWA is independent of government and the Libs should understand that by now Time expired The Gillard government investment in health means 2 000 more nurses in our emergency departments 5 189 thousand more GPs in practice or in training 1 300 extra subacute beds more than 60 GP superclinics and more than 420 infrastructure I thank the member for Moreton I got a little bit excited when the member for Dickson got up earlier I thought I might have got a health question from the member for Dickson It is 252 days since I My question is to the Minister for Health Will the minister update the House on how the government is getting on with the job of ensuring all ns have access to quality health care Under your government The member for Fadden will be led outside in a minute if he is not careful It is under the New South Wales government which manages the New South Wales health system In fact under this government we see historically high rates of bulk billing we see PBS reforms that have reduced the cost of 1 Mr President I ask a  I refer to s that bosses of the n Maritime Union which is affiliated with and a major donor for the Labor Party are hindering police and government efforts to clean up the I thank  for his ongoing interest in industrial relations Dealing with news s today concerning allegations 8212 perhaps it is worth while finalising the Victorian ETU matter 8212 are the subject of Federal Court proceedings This government is I thank  for his question As I was saying if he does have evidence of the serious allegations that he raises he should provide them to the relevant authority I am confident that Fair Work  according to Mr President I have a further  I note the minister and his answer to the primary question mentioned the CEPU so I refer to concerns about the bosses of the CEPU also a Labor donor engaging in unauthorised My question is to  I refer  to the fact that the West Adelaide Football Club is facing an increase of 32 000 in its power bill this year because of the carbon tax and To the member s question first  asserts something which is false It is misleading to attribute as the member has the entire electricity price rise experienced by football clubs or indeed any other entity to the carbon price My question is to the Minister for Broadband Communications and the Digital Economy Senator Conroy Has the minister seen the recent statement by Jeremy Hunt about the UK s ambition for broadband and does this have implications for n broadband I understand that the opposition would be embarrassed when once again their fear campaign has been shown to be false but I do believe I have an obligation to the House when  that contains a falsity is asked I seek leave to table the article Leave not granted   I rise on a point of order  was asked whether she would apologise to the parents of junior footballers for saying There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead 8212 The Manager of Opposition Business will  his seat  is answering  Who dreamed up cutting workers compensation in New South Wales It was a Liberal Premier Who in Queensland dreamed up cutting 25 000 jobs It was an LNP Premier These people in Queensland where you have Jeff Kennett lite trying My question is to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation Will the minister update the House on how the government is making sure that the jobs and workplaces of the future are I thank the member for La Trobe for her question because I can assure her and all members of the House that we are standing up for everyday Aussies that we are standing up for ordinary people when it comes The member for Cook is warned My question is to  Will  guarantee not to increase the government debt to pay for the government s big new spending promises on an NDIS submarines and asylum seekers Will  give I have to say I am admiring of the member for North Sydney s gumption He obviously thinks the best means of defence is attack This government will bring the budget to surplus The opposition has 70 billion unaccounted for   I rise on a point of order The point of order is relevance I asked  will she guarantee that she will not increase government debt to pay for her  I actually stated I would listen carefully to  s answer as she had only just commenced It is for the chair to determine relevancy or not  has just commenced her answer I will listen carefully Mrs Mirabella interjecting 8212 The member for Indi is now pushing the envelope  will return to  before the chair We will fund our Labor agenda by finding offsetting savings and making the necessary arrangements in the government s budget as we have shown our ability to do and we will bring the budget to surplus We will do those   on a point of order She is defying your ruling You asked her to be directly relevant and it was a very specific question The n people are entitled to know that What they will know from us is we will manage the budget responsibly A point of order  under the standing order which requires that people be referred to according to their titles  is the title Let me say to the member for North Sydney again next time he wants to ask  like this bring in what shows where your 70 billion worth of cuts are going to fall Bring in how much money The Leader of the House will  his seat  has the call The member for North Sydney will  his seat The Leader of the House will  his seat The member for North Sydney has the call   8212   on a point of order there are provisions for a suspension of standing orders under the processes of the parliament with regard to House of Reps Practice House of Reps Practice refers to the process by which I used to think  saw the whips office as a safe haven It is not safe out there 8212 I too would like to contribute to this debate today this motion to take note of answers in  and put to rest some of the outrageous claims made in particular by Senator Birmingham and Senator Edwards It is I move That the member be no longer heard  is that the member be no longer heard I move That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Member for North Sydney moving immediately 8212 That this House condemns the Government for failing to honour its promises to the n people I rise to take note of answers given by Senator Wong In one of her answers she made reference to the inaugural appearance of my colleague Senator Birmingham on Q amp A last night I must say that when she I was not going to mention it but I did not see Q amp A last night and I am sure s in this place did their parties proud I had something far more important to do than watch   another point of order having had the opportunity to look at the motion now I move That the member be no longer heard Is the motion seconded I second the motion The Treasurer dreams of being called surplus Swan but he will be forever known as wasteful Wayne Warren Buffet predicted this when he said It s only when the tide goes out that you discover 8212   a point of order we do not have a copy of the motion before the House that is being attempted to be moved Copies of the motion are being sought  is that the member be no longer heard As I was saying the Treasurer will be known as wasteful Wayne I thank Senator Sterle for the support he gave the industry last year Had he not given it such support the industry might not have been returned quite so quickly But I do remind Senator Sterle again that I did I move That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Broadband Communications and the Digital Economy Senator Conroy to  without notice asked by Senator Waters today relating to the protection of koalas I Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented   I ask that further  be placed on the Notice Paper   I wish to make a personal explanation Finally  claimed that I would keep the carbon tax Let me just say when I say there will be no carbon tax under a government I lead I am telling the truth The Leader of the Opposition knows that he can only refer to where he claims to have been misrepresented The health minister claimed that I had cut 1 billion from hospital funding This is false Hospital funding increased by 17 per cent in real terms when I was the health minister  claimed falsely that I intended The Leader of the Opposition has the call Serially in  today The time for the debate has expired  s assertion is patently false In fact I said I can make the guarantee that no school will be worse off under a Coalition government 8212 because our policy is the current quantum of funds plus six  on a point of order if the member just wants to table the  it will be allowed and we can move on On what basis The Leader of the House is seeking the call  suggested in  today that I have an agenda to reduce funding to public schools Why is the Leader of the House standing at the dispatch box In  today  selectively quoted from a transcript of mine from a doorstop interview this morning in an attempt to pretend that I somehow have a policy of reducing funding to public schools I do most grievously Does the Manager of Opposition Business claim to have been misrepresented   I wish to make a personal explanation The Manager of Opposition Business will  his seat On behalf of Senator Feeney I move That the government business orders of the day relating to the Customs Amendment Anti dumping Improvements Bill No 2 2011 the Customs Amendment Anti dumping Improvements Bill No 2 2012 and the Customs

speak to both Greens amendments 1 and 3 as the thrust of both is the opting out provisions This amendment seeks to retain the frisk search as an alternative screening The coalition will not be

to speak on this important  the Transport Safety Investigation Amendment Bill 2012 Rail safety in terms of passenger and freight movements attracts a high level of attention in my electorate of Paterson as well as for If some members on the government side had their way I would not be standing here speaking because on this very critical issue that goes to the protection of our borders and the ability of a national government to exercise Air travel safety clearly is a priority and we have the responsibility to get that right So many of the authorities in this area have identified what they often call a layered approach One of the Greens concerns is that I thank  for her question I can indicate that the government has considered these alternatives and has rejected the approach that is being taken I would ask you to consider the changes that have occurred in the n Senator Joyce has indicated that the coalition will not be supporting this and of course I support that position I acknowledge that we are talking about international travel but I say to the mover of the amendment that this is  is that item 4 on Schedule 1 stand as printed Question agreed to The issue of costs has been brought up but what is more relevant here if we want to talk about costs is that that is actually one of the reasons the government has given for making this change The minister I rise also to

protection Sadly I rise to speak on the Transport Safety Investigation Amendment Bill 2012 This bill is an important piece of  in terms of consolidating the amount of regulators into a national system

relevant I would have thought No you actually need to be relevant to While we are on the subject we can refer to before us This is not a history lesson it is actually a bill before the parliament I will continue to remind people that you actually need to be   the positions of the government and the opposition are entirely germane to before the parliament I would suggest Then you can draw it reference it to In that respect   it is important to understand the policy journey that has gotten us to where we are today including for example the current  s view 8212 and I quote from the House Hansard This is not reference I have asked you to reference 8212 to make reference to before us No everybody has had a wide ranging debate about political issues as opposed to referring to If you just come back to and say how it relates to that is all I am asking   offshore processing which I think is encompassed within 8212 Thank you That is all I have asked I rise to join others in honouring

rise to speak on the Migration  Amendment Offshore Processing and Other Measures Bill 2011 today because in many respects it is the culmination of years of debate around the way in which this country should tackle the asylum has been an interesting journey as to why the government has now adopted the policy of offshore processing given  s position according to the House Hansard of 13 May 2003 when she said Labor will end the From the very first page of his mighty work The Fatal Shore the late Robert Hughes gets the reader in with his superb use of words In 1770 Captain James Cook had made

come to the chamber today to participate in this parliament s tribute to the n veterans who served in Bomber Command in World War II As has already been well testified Bomber Command was a multinational allied force that As a former defence minister the opportunity to speak to this motion certainly caught my eye and I have seized the opportunity Having said that I would not claim to be an expert on Bomber Command but I think that In rising to say a few words on the Migration  Amendment Offshore Processing and Other Measures Bill 2011 my remarks are coloured by the fact that the last time I was in this House listening to this debate a I rise to speak on the commemoration for the 70th anniversary of Bomber Command and to honour all those British n and Allied servicemen and women who sacrificed their lives in what was one of the most perilous times that It gives me a great deal of pleasure to follow Senator McKenzie s words in the brief time before we go on to other business I would like to echo the sentiments of my coalition colleagues who have some concerns The first of July this year marked the 80th anniversary of the n Broadcasting Corporation The ABC is a national institution and one of the world s great public broadcasters It is not without fault but too often it has It is with great honour that I rise with colleagues on  of this House to pay tribute to the

leave of the House to move government amendments 1 to 39 as circulated together Leave granted I move government amendments 1 to 39 as circulated together 1 As I referred to  the amendments moved by the government have been brought together as a result of the minister and I working together on this I thank him for that and for the acceptance of the proposals put I do not support the amendments and I rise to speak against them A number of the reasons I and the Greens have for speaking against the amendments have been eloquently summarised in a letter sent today to the Prime  is that government amendments 1 to 39 be agreed to A division having been called and the bells having been rung 8212 As there are fewer than five members on the side for the noes I declare the Last night in this place during the adjournment debate I had the pleasure of listening to one of my colleagues Senator Thistlethwaite speaking on volunteering I was really interested in what he had to say He talked

satisfied of the national interest in regard to certain matters I will lay it on I rise to contribute some comments on industrial wind turbines Whilst the whole question of the economic benefit or

expired I draw the attention of honourable senators to the presence in the chamber of a parliamentary delegation from Ireland led by Senator Denis O Donovan On behalf of all senators I wish you a warm welcome to  and in My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Defence Senator Bob Carr Is the minister aware of s of whether substantial cuts to defence announced in the May budget have resulted in a decision to no longer supply I did not hear that I will allow the point of order I believe the minister has been answering  If the minister has any time remaining the minister can address the point of order Mr President I ask a  I thank the minister for his assurance that the rising sun badge will continue Is the minister aware of s that soldiers from the n Army Reserve units have ed that they are I have seen no such s I discount them completely and I will seek further advice from my colleague the Minister for Defence I am happy to assure the Senate that the Army advises there is no shortage of blank or live ammunition Ammunition has not been affected by budget cuts Army training whether through dry drills or through the use of blank Honourable Senators Honourable senators interjecting 8212 Order Senator Macdonald I cannot give you the call because people are interjecting across the chamber Mr President my question which the minister did not even attempt to answer was is it true that Army training days 8212 that is Reserve training 8212 are being cut from 100 to 21 to allow for the limited ammunition I am not clear is this a point of order Sorry I did say that I raise a point of order and it is on relevance Mr President he rested his credibility today in  on the allegation that soldiers were required to say bang bang instead of firing bullets Mr President on the point of order the minister is very kindly giving an answer about my credibility I did not ask him about my credibility I asked him about whether the 51st Far North Queensland Regiment training days are He started with the absurd allegation that soldiers were required to say bang bang instead of firing bullets and he is wrong The Army itself advises him and advises this house that the allegation is absurd and entirely wrong He Order There is  of order The minister has 40 seconds remaining There is  of order The minister has 40 seconds Mr President on the point of order the minister is 20 seconds into his answer He is perfectly entitled in answering  to address issues raised in  He is providing an answer to the Senate and the Mr President I ask a further  I take it from the minister s refusal to answer that the suggestion that they have been cut from 100 to 21 is not true and I am grateful for that Is Order On my right Senator Evans is on his feet Mr President I rise on a point of order The point of order is relevance The minister has already in effect taken  on notice by saying that he would seek advice He cannot now relevantly be permitted to Order This is not time to argue You can answer  but it is not a debating time Continue I will seek further advice on the training days available to the unit he mentions but the credibility of  is 8212 by leave 8212 It is in that spirit that I move That further statements on indulgence on the London Olympic Games be permitted in the Federation Chamber I intend to list that for debate tomorrow morning Question agreed to My question is to  I refer  to her comments on 22 February last year when she said I 8230 want to be very clear with ns about what pricing carbon does It has price The Manager of Opposition Business will  his seat Points of order are not to  debate I was making the simple point that we obviously care about these impacts on working families the opposition has not indicated that they care about those 50 60 or 70 per cent rises For the Leader of the Opposition pricing On a point of order    was asked about her statement that the whole point of the carbon tax was to push up prices She is now talking about something that has nothing to do The whole point of putting a price on carbon is to reduce carbon pollution and you do that by sending the biggest polluters a price signal by charging them a price per tonne for the amount of carbon pollution that My question is also to the Minister for Foreign Affairs Senator Bob Carr Can the minister update the Senate on the situation for women and girls in Afghanistan Improving the lives of women and girls around the world is a top priority for this government It is an important feature of  s ambitious aid program We have advocated and continue to advocate for it strongly I am The Leader of the Opposition will  his seat  is out of order   I ask a  Can  confirm that every time power prices go up she has a smile on her face because that is the carbon tax just doing its job Mr President I ask a  I thank the minister for his answer but can he advise the Senate of what the n government is doing to actually improve the situation there My question is to  Will  update the House on actions to tackle people smuggling I thank the member for Greenway for her question Today the House has put in place arrangements for offshore processing Today the House has done what the n people have wanted us to do for a long time We have The Senate will appreciate that  has a great responsibility in Oruzgan province where our lead role has made a difference to security outcomes But in terms of the contribution of n development aid I can  with pride 8212 Mr President I ask a further  Can the minister actually advise particularly in relation to maternal health in the province of what n support can offer One very sobering indicator out of Oruzgan province 8212 again an indicator of the poverty and the background of the whole country 8212 is that every year around 300 mothers and 3 000 children under the age of five die My question is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation Senator Wong I refer the minister to the fact that the government s stock of outstanding debt has grown by 5 billion since the beginning of this financial year to I appreciate  from the shadow Treasurer He was the parliamentarian who tweeted asking ns what he should do about climate change particularly when he has had a lifelong support for a price on carbon So enough of the   on a point of order  was will the Treasurer apologise for lying to the n people You never once got your budget right There s been a 34 billion blow out in debt This side of the House will always do the right thing by the n people and our nation And we will do it in the face of the most negative opposition in  s history They are not interested in Order We are on to question 2 8212 I just point that out The Treasurer has the call and will be heard in silence Order Senator Cormann I draw to your attention that Senator Joyce is on his feet I do not know how to explain it to Senator Joyce I have given him the figures on gross and net debt I have given them to him on previous occasions It is true that there is obviously an issue It is an abuse of a point of order If he is asking about relevance he does not need to introduce argument The Treasurer has the call My question is to the Treasurer I remind the Treasurer that this is the second anniversary of his statement We reject this hysterical allegation that somehow we are moving towards a carbon tax Given the Treasurer has introduced the world The minister is answering  The minister has 35 seconds remaining to answer  Thank you Once more I raise a point of order on relevance  asked why the debt has gone up by 5 billion in seven weeks if they are telling us they are going to have a 1 189 The member for North Sydney on a supplementary Senator Wong you have one minute 40 seconds to address  and you should address  that has been asked by Senator Joyce Mr President I rise on a point of order It is obviously on relevance Her answer has not dealt in any way shape or form with  although she might want to address it to the Labor Party who Thank you Mr President I am very happy to address  As  would know because he has asked me  about gross debt and net debt previously gross debt peaked as a percentage of GDP in 2011 I thank  for his question and I congratulate him on having a small win over the Liberals on foreign investments I do not agree with it but I congratulate him on his win

In the short time I have to speak today on this Migration  Amendment Regional Processing and Other Measures Bill 2012 I want to deal with an aspect that has been seldom referred to in this very emotive debate There I support many of the words set down by the member for Wills in relation to the Illegal Logging Prohibition Bill 2011 I congratulate him on the fact that he is possibly the expert in the House on this issue On a point of order Mr Acting  I remind the member for Dawson to speak to He is not speaking to He absolutely is While the coalition does not oppose the Fisheries  Amendment Bill No 1 2012 I personally do have some concerns about it Those concerns are partly about what the  contains and partly about what it does not contain My I ask him to address the  before us and not go on some frolic around the Coral Sea This is an absolutely insane proposal which is to do with the  We are talking about monitoring the fishing industry and the data we can get from the industry Yet this proposal we have is not based on any I call the member for Dawson It is good that the opposition have in principle consideration after three s have called for action 8212 but they still find ways of not supporting a very good bill They always find something to do with process or whatever I rise today to speak on the Migration  Amendment Regional Processing and Other Measures Bill 2012 I am deeply saddened that here we are yet again debating  which is designed to punish and demonise people merely because they In addressing the Fisheries  Amendment Bill No 1 2012 I am delighted to offer the opposition s support This bill essentially does two things Firstly it opens up the potential for comprehensive electronic monitoring of fisheries catch and processes I rise to speak on the Illegal Logging Prohibition Bill 2011 and note that the coalition has circulated an amendment to this bill which in effect is to delay the start up of the proposed  and the penalties and Firstly I thank those

been a colossal effort and I take the opportunity to acknowledge the work you do in the House More importantly I rise Since coming to office the n Labor Party and their allies the Greens have failed

chamber for three sitting weeks but I am learning a lot about government parliamentarians and the responsibility that we all share I reflect upon what is going through my mind sometimes when Hopefully we won t That s the point Hopefully we won t None of us want to see refugees getting onto boats and taking dangerous journeys That is something we all share in common If we are wrong on this and the numbers keep increasing simple arithmetic says The member for Bradfield has joined in the passing parade of coalition MPs who have alleged based in part on a story in the Financial Review that the relationship between  and Indonesia has been severely strained and damaged over There was such an inevitability to the debate that we are having today on the Migration  Amendment Regional Processing and Other Measures Bill 2012 It was inevitable from the moment that the n Labor Party won office in 2007 I too rise to make some very brief remarks following the comprehensive and heartfelt contributions of my colleagues on this side of this place on the Migration  Amendment Regional Processing and Other Measures Bill 2012 Notwithstanding some of the Order I remind senators that speakers have the right to be heard in silence You refused to participate in the committee Thank you Mr Acting  Rather the Gillard government chose to contract out that responsibility to a committee to make the decisions for it The former Chief of the Defence Force Angus Houston Michael L Estrange and Paris Aristotle I thank all the honourable members for their contributions to this important debate I wish to start by addressing the comments of those opposite They relied heavily on an article published in the Financial Review earlier this year to support The modern history of the migration debate

secretary in this area having Thank you Mr Acting  I withdraw those comments Immigration has always been about order and process Millions of people have come to this country and abided by those processes They have come here after waiting in queues People As I mentioned earlier 8212 and as is well known publicly 8212 the coalition promised the n electorate that they would implement  to prohibit the trade and processing of illegally harvested timber and timber products Now they are being Order Senator Fierravanti Wells I remind you it is not appropriate to reflect on the character or

that entrepreneur Dick Smith is with us today in this building I congratulate him for being in his own words game to stand up to the Murdoch press and others in big business and actually admit The proclamations and the policies from the ALP and the coalition suggest that they believe a solution is something that frightens asylum seekers away from  We have heard a great deal from  of the chamber on that Order Senators on my left are reminded that senators have the right to be heard in silence As a number of my colleagues have remarked it also gives me no pleasure whatsoever to rise and speak in opposition to the Migration  Amendment Regional Processing and Other Measures Bill 2012 I will briefly reflect as many of Community service and the tax office 8212 who would have thought that these phrases could be used in the same sentence Let me say it is not such a real paradox The ATO is simply one of those agencies we I take this opportunity to praise the good work of Warilla Public School

their commitment to this important piece of public policy This  is of great importance to the  is that the motion be agreed to I ask all honourable members to signify their approval by rising in their places Question agreed to honourable members standing in their places Thank you Mr President Today marks the second anniversary of the Labor  s solemn promise to the n people that there will be no carbon tax under the government I lead Does the minister agree that this broken My question is to the Minister representing  Today marks the second anniversary of the Labor  s solemn promise to the n people that there will be no carbon tax under the government I lead Government Order Very touchy aren t they Senator Abetz you are entitled to be heard in silence Order on my right Senator Abetz like anyone in this place is entitled to be heard in silence Senator Abetz continue That is pretty brazen That is pretty arrogant What is  doing Senator we have had a lot of arrogance from you guys in the last two days Mr President the opposition would be better served by focusing on policy on how we meet the great challenges that  faces rather than My question is to  I refer  to her promise made precisely two years ago today that There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead Will  now apologise to I could equally talk about how it is one year since the shadow finance minister made clear that there was a 70 billion black hole in the Liberal Party s costings One year ago and apparently it is the anniversary Order Senator Evans  your seat Order on  Mr President Senator Abetz is just full of rhetoric There is no substance to his question There is no interest in the big policy  of the day This is an opposition who have no relevance to anyone They have I inform the House that the Minister for Housing Minister for Homelessness and Minister for Small Business will be absent from  today for personal reasons The Minister for Families Community Services and Indigenous Affairs will answer  in The Leader of the Opposition will withdraw unreservedly The Leader of the Opposition has been in this parliament long enough to know that that is unparliamentary language and he will withdraw   I rise on a point of order The opposition finds it offensive that  should make statements which are not true and she should withdraw that statement If they had cared to listen 8212 I have asked for the word to be withdrawn It is unparliamentary and cannot be used regardless of your frustration or circumstances There are other forms of the House that are available to   I rise on a point of order going to your ruling How is it in order for  to make unbased assertions and not be pulled up on them The Leader of the Opposition will  his seat The Leader of the Opposition is well aware that there are other forms of the House in which he can pursue that if he wishes to but he can not use The Leader of the Opposition will  his seat He will now withdraw It is wrong it is misleading and she should not say it The Leader of the Opposition will withdraw   what  said 8212 that the carbon tax would stay 8212 is wrong Of course since carbon pricing started on 1 July according to the TD Securities Melbourne Institute price index inflation has been at 0 2 per cent That is one fifth of 1c for every dollar spent The Leader of the The Manager of Opposition Business is warned Abusing points of order throughout  is inappropriate  has the call She has just commenced her answer I am happy to withdraw but I repeat it is wrong 8212 The Leader of the Opposition will  his seat The member for Deakin has the call I will not continue this debate But   8212 I must admit I am not surprised by the Leader of the Opposition s question and I would say to the Leader of the Opposition that if he wants to talk about anniversaries then it is six weeks from 1 The Leader of the Opposition will  his seat   I rise on a point of order It is about direct relevance  was asked about her promise two years ago and that is what she has to answer Mr President I ask a  I refer the minister to the words of Ms Gillard in 2005 and listen to this 8230 the Labor Party is the party of truth telling When we go out into the electorate It is a shame I think Senator Abetz did not take my advice and continued to ask his prewritten  which had been carefully crafted in the tactics committee because they had found a quote from 2005 and they I can put the leader out of his misery We will repeal the carbon tax if the n people give us a mandate to do so My further  is was  similarly engaged in truth telling Mr President I was tempted to go to Godwin Grech 8212 but I won t 8212 when we think about honesty and appropriate behaviour because Senator Abetz reminds me of his own behaviour I think the n people as I My question is to  Will  update the House on the outlook for manufacturing as part of a clean energy future I thank the member for Deakin for his question The member for Deakin I am sure as someone very interested in jobs for ns in manufacturing today and jobs in manufacturing tomorrow would be pleased to hear that the  I draw to the attention of honourable senators the presence in the chamber of a parliamentary delegation from Laos led by Her Excellency  Pany President of the Lao National Assembly On behalf of all senators I wish you a My question is to the Minister for Tertiary Education Skills Science and Research Senator Evans Can the minister advise the Senate on how the government s investment in  s higher education system has been reflected in the Academic Ranking Senator Joyce you may not be interested in regional education but this government is That is why the numbers are up so much and that is why they are thriving The National Party may not think education is important but I thank  for his question  s release of the Academic Ranking of World Universities was an outstanding demonstration of the quality and depth of the n university system  now has the third highest number of universities Senator Joyce you will cease interjecting Senator Joyce have a look at the rural and regional figures Why are they doing so well It is because we funded them properly Your disinterest on this issue does you no credit  s future is as a smart Order I remind senators that interjections are disorderly Are you ahead of Nauru or behind Nauru The government has always said carbon pricing would affect electricity prices that families pay and that effect would be 10 per cent It is 10 per cent and because we knew that there would be that price flow through we The ticket to a strong future is a better future in education By opening up the doors of university education we are unlocking the potential of thousands more ns who have been denied access in the past One of the Mr President I ask a  Can the minister advise the Senate on how the government s investment in  s higher education system has transformed access and participation Mr President one of the pleasing things is not only that we have been able to increase the number of ns accessing university education and the numbers graduating we are actually increasing excellence in the sector at the same time Senator Evans please  your seat Senators Conroy and Joyce it is completely disorderly to exchange comments across this chamber during  I am seeking to listen to the answer of the minister Please continue Minister Another National supports the NBN 8212 Richard Torbay Give us a demonstration of how you roll over  will return to  before the chair The member for Mackellar will  her seat  has the call I refer you to page 555 of the Practice which points out that not all areas are covered by the standing orders relating to answers including one of verballing the opposition It does say however that you have the power A point of relevance has already been made   on a point of order 8212 Thank you  In terms of the impact on electricity prices the government has always been crystal clear about this We said n households and n families should expect to see a 10 per cent increase in their electricity I was asked what the carbon price was designed to do and I am explaining that I am also explaining that former  Howard Brendan Nelson the member for Wentworth and for much of the time that he has The Manager of Opposition Business will  his seat  has the call and will return to  before the chair   I rise on a point of order  could not have been any more straightforward and tight  only needs to say whether it would increase or decrease electricity prices That is  The carbon price is designed to reduce carbon pollution just as when  Howard announced that if he was re elected in 2007 he would legislate an emissions trading scheme The purpose of that price on carbon was to  has been asked I would have thought people would like to hear the answer Ms Julie Bishop interjecting 8212 The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is warned Opposition Members Opposition members interjecting 8212 The carbon tax is designed to decrease carbon pollution The carbon tax is designed so that our biggest polluters pay a price on carbon pollution My question is to  Is the carbon tax designed to increase or to decrease the price of electricity You have no values That s not true Senator Mason you are excused You are the exception which is why you did not gain favour under the former  because he was not interested in it either A good university system is vital to this country s Order on  Mr President I ask a further  Can the minister advise of any policy threats to these successes Senator Conroy interjecting 8212 Senator Joyce interjecting 8212 I think the behaviour of Senator Joyce through this question period is showing exactly what the problem is The opposition have no interest in higher education Their record in government was to slash 8212 My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency Senator Wong I refer the minister to the 2012 edition of KPMG s Guide to International Business Location Costs the most thorough comparison of international Order Government members are denying  the call The parliamentary secretary 8212 and he knows which one I am referring to 8212 is warned  has the call Honourable Members Honourable members interjecting 8212 I think it is interesting that Senator Cormann in his question refers to Europe as somewhere  should look to when it comes to competitiveness If Senator Cormann wants to have double digit unemployment if Senator Cormann wants to have Mr President I ask a  Now that  has admitted that the carbon tax will increase the price of electricity will she also admit that it will not actually reduce emissions which go up from 578  will be relevant to  before the chair You have asked  three times to come to  and she still has not talked about the rise in emissions by eight per cent When the Leader of the Opposition was sitting in the Howard cabinet designing a price on carbon he too would have known that it is the most efficient way of reducing carbon pollution And because of the carbon pricing scheme  was asked about the reduction in emissions I am going to ask her to return to that part of  All right  will  her seat The Manager of Opposition Business has a point of order If it was about relevance I was about to ask  to return to  Because of our carbon pricing policy our nation will hit our target of reducing carbon emissions by five per cent by 2020 The Leader of the Opposition who is obviously desperately casting around to create some drama here would well know that from the day we announced carbon pricing we were very clear about the impact on electricity prices for families The Mr President I have a  I refer the minister to KPMG s analysis of electricity costs which showed that  s power costs are already the highest of all 14 developed and developing nations studied and that the Mr President I ask a further  Can  confirm that the government s own modelling shows that  s domestic emissions rise from 578 million tonnes in 2010 to 621 million tonnes by 2020 despite the I will do my best but a I cannot see how that was a  and b that was a speech not  It was a statement not  But I am very happy to talk about The page from the government s own modelling indicating the truth of an eight per cent increase in domestic emissions and indicating that they only 8212 The Leader of the Opposition is seeking to table a  I have yet another  Why are the government and the minister in particular trying to blame shift yet again when it has the direct power to bring power prices down now by getting rid of its carbon tax The Leader of the Opposition will  his seat The option available to table a  is to stand and refer to the  and not to use it as an opportunity for more debate Is leave granted for the I can confirm for the Leader of the Opposition that our carbon pricing scheme will enable us to reach our minus five per cent target by 2020 which from the Leader of the Opposition s earlier statements I had understood No Mr President it is pretty desperate isn t it in the face of the facts that the vast majority of the increase we have seen in electricity prices 8212 for which there has been no assistance 8212 has been for Mr President I rise on a point of order going to relevance I appreciate the minister is reading from a prepared brief but it is not a brief for  that I asked  I asked was whether Order The member for Berowra is warned  of course is not a party to this decision It is a matter between Mr Assange and the governments of Ecuador and the United Kingdom The court case that led to this affair arising in this fashion is between My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs Senator Bob Carr Minister in response to several carloads of metropolitan police entering the building that houses the Ecuadorian embassy in the middle of the night London time cordoning off the My question is to the Treasurer Treasurer what does recent data say about the strength of the n economy and what is the n government doing to ensure the economy remains strong Have you spoken to Henry Kissinger about it Honourable Members Honourable members interjecting 8212 Mr President  s question is based on the assumption the building is being occupied by Metropolitan Police I have not been advised of that To date there have been 62 representations made by the n government about the There is  of order The minister is answering  I inform the House that we have present in the gallery  members of the Argentine Mission to   led by their able ambassador On behalf of the House I extend a very warm welcome to the members I do not think it would be of the remotest interest to Henry Kissinger Time expired In the face of ongoing global uncertainty the n economy continues to outperform virtually every other advanced economy In the year to March our economy has grown by 4 3 per cent That is more than twice that experienced by Opposition Members Opposition members interjecting 8212 Order The Treasurer will  his seat I ask him to withdraw the use if I just heard him use the word lie 8212 Mr Robert interjecting 8212 Order The member for Fadden The difficulty I have is that I I do withdraw   Over the past year the Leader of the Opposition has been running around like Chicken Little saying the sky is going to fall in And of course in that time our economy has gone Ecuadorian authorities at 10 pm tonight if they grant asylum to n citizen Julian Assange Minister I am going to take it that your answer to my question is No representations were not made If you feel like you need to correct the record then please do My  is 8212 Senator Chris Evans Order Just wait Senator Ludlam I will give you the call when there is a silence You are entitled to be heard in silence I thank the member for Fraser because the recent data puts a wrecking ball right through the Leader of the Opposition s aggressively negative campaign talking down our economy He was saying the price rises would go through the roof   I ask a  The Treasurer has spoken about the strong performance in the full knowledge of carbon pricing of the n economy Is there more recent data that supports this Mr President  of whether the Ecuadorian government grants Mr Assange asylum is a matter for them We will seek information on it but we will not make representations to them one way or the other It is not Mr President first might I say that that is entirely hypothetical There is no evidence of interest in him from the United States government If extradition of Mr Assange were sought on a charge to which capital punishment would apply Mr President I thank the minister for his answer and I ask a further  Can the minister tell the Senate what the government will do beyond providing basic consular assistance to protect Mr Assange if there is evidence Order The Manager of Opposition Business will  his seat The Treasurer has the call Mr Ewen Jones interjecting 8212 The Leader of the Opposition has endorsed the remarks of the Premier of Queensland 8212 Order The member for Herbert will remove himself from the chamber under standing order 94 a The member for Herbert then left the chamber that the Queensland economy was like Spain This was one of the most deeply irresponsible statements that has ever been made by a political leader in this country 8212 and it has been endorsed by the Leader of the Opposition   I rise on a point of order I put it to you that it is disorderly for the Treasurer to continue to make false assertions about what the Leader of the Opposition believes and what he does I know the circumstances of working ns pensioners and people raising kids might be a matter of comedy for the opposition but for the government it is deadly serious business We will continue to do everything we can to work My question is to  Will  confirm that the government s own modelling says that at least three million n households will be worse off under her carbon tax To the Leader of the Nationals question we have always said we were providing assistance to nine out of 10 households As a Labor government in the provision of assistance we of course have sought to benefit middle and low Opposition Members Opposition members interjecting 8212 Mr President my question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency Senator Wong Is the minister aware of recent analysis conducted by the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling at the University of My recollection and this is going back some time is that one of the reasons for the lesser increase in South  is that South  has a higher proportion of renewable energy so therefore you see a lower level I want to recognise Graham Edwards our former colleague who is in the gallery and to clarify that I did exclude the member for Herbert under 94 a My question is to  The government is relying on the n Fisheries Management Authority in the super trawler Margiris matter But AFMA has admitted that it did not take the Fisheries Administration Act literally when it decided Mr President I ask a  I thank the minister but she says that the largest component of the price rise has not been the carbon tax Is she then aware that the ACT s independent Competition and Regulatory   on a point of order  in answering  said she was being asked for a legal opinion  that asks for a legal opinion is out of order and therefore  I must apologise I was seeking to clarify something that has nothing to do with anybody else in the chamber at the moment and I did not hear that If she did then the member for Mackellar is correct and I was just about to say to the member for Denison that I am well aware of concerns about this vessel this super trawler because they have been raised with me by Tasmanian members of the government and raised with I did not ask for it I thank the member for Denison for his question The member for Denison is raising with me effectively a legal issue about the operation of the n Fisheries Management Authority As I am advised the n Fisheries Manage 173 ment You did not ask and you have not sought to clarify it on that basis I am answering  Senator Abetz the problem is you do not like the answer because the truth is not something you wish to discuss when it comes to electricity prices nor does  wish to discuss the  has concluded her answer I am not promising a legal opinion I am referring to some advice I have received about the n Fisheries Management Authority working within the ambit of the Fisheries Administration Act The member for Denison is seeking clarification on  that  has heard and is answering I thank the member for Denison Again I would refer to my previous answer which is that the vast majority over the numbers of years of the increases in electricity prices has been as a result of investment in poles and wires I would refer the Answer    I raise a point of order on relevance I have pointed out simply that the Ombudsman is making inquiries into the behaviour of AFMA 8212 and that is a fact I have simply asked  I am not asking for a legal opinion I am 8212 Mr President I ask a further  Again the minister says that the government is providing assistance Is she aware that the ACT Labor government has analysed this situation and found that 60 per cent of Canberra households are We made our decision to focus the assistance to n families on those who need it most and that is people on the pension people on family tax benefit and people earning under 80 000 per year who will receive My question is to the Minister for Human Services Senator Kim Carr How does the minister account for the rising wait times across Centrelink call times I thank Senator Furner for his question This is one that rightly every senator and every member is entitled to ask As we are obviously strongly focused on the issues of people waiting to get service it is a matter This is no reflection on the professional staff at call centres or those who support them in back offices it is simply a reality of Public Service delivery today We are dealing with the volatility of the global economy we Order Senator Carr  your seat Senator Joyce and Senator Conroy I remind you that interjections across the chamber are disorderly There have been repeated occasions where I have reminded you of this today The minister is entitled to be I do understand the concerns I have heard them loud and clear But the approach the government is going to take is that we will have this work process the minister for fishing and the parliamentary secretary 8212 a person   I ask a   it is a fact that the Ombudsman is making inquiries into the conduct of AFMA as it should My question and I would be very grateful 8212 in fact Tasmania Order The member for Greenway will commence her question again She should not have to yell to be heard My question is to the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and Minister for Industry and Innovation Will the minister outline the significant action being taken here and overseas to reduce pollution Why is it important that the debate The coalition are very fond of anniversaries that has been raised today It is three years since the Leader of the Opposition said he supported a carbon tax That is what it is it is the third year anniversary of The minister s answer outlined why facts are important in our efforts to tackle dangerous climate change Can he give more examples of why this is important Factual information is very important Take for example the assertion made by the member for Boothby  in relation to the Belair Hotel It is fascinating that on having a look at the carbon price is in fact Member for Boothby do you have a point of order I do not rise on a point of order The minister has just used the words mendacious deceit and 8212 The member will  his seat If I asked everybody to draw everything we would be here all day I am putting a line in the sand on one word I rise to ask a  The minister s answer 8212 Honourable members interjecting 8212 I withdraw  Make no mistake about this the carbon price has come in and people are starting to realise what a fraudulent campaign this is And they also know that the greatest fraudulent claim of all is that The minister will withdraw I thank the member for Greenway for her question Last year acting on the scientific advice countries around the world including all the major emitters and including  8212 committed to take on legal obligations from 2020 to reduce greenhouse Mr President I have a  Can the minister inform the Senate what action the government is taking to reduce these waiting times First and foremost we are investing in our staff which is the most important asset the Commonwealth has in terms of human services delivery We are putting more people on the phones Since March this year the department has recruited Mr President I ask a further  What role does the minister see for new technologies in responding to the demand We need of course to ensure that new technologies provide an important part of the new service delivery models We are providing options in terms of call back We are providing new apps to provide direct access for students to Honourable Senators Honourable senators interjecting 8212 I am asked What about the knuckle draggers Of course the real problem here is that the knuckles are now being taken off the ground 8212 and in science we can expect some evolution 8212 to an attack directly into My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency Senator Wong I refer the minister to the fact that the carbon tax has caused an almost threefold increase in the cost of refrigerant gases It might have been useful if the tactics committee had let the good senator know that this issue has been raised previously in the house on a number of 8212 Thank you Mr President In late July for example an enforceable undertaking was accepted by the ACCC from a refrigeration contractor Equipserve to correct incorrect claims regarding price increases being wholly due to the carbon price So I would urge Order I am actually trying to be of assistance In fact it has been quite demonstrably shown that a number of the assertions made I think by Ms Mirabella were not correct In fact this has led for example to the You don t like answering  do you I inform the House that we have present in the gallery  members of a parliamentary delegation from the Lao People 8217 s Democratic Republic led by the President of the Lao National Assembly Her Excellency  Pany Yathortou My question is to  I refer  to the Western Suburbs Leagues Club in my Hinkler electorate which has just received its July electricity account showing that carbon tax almost doubled the off peak power Mr President I ask a  What does the government say to those fruit and vegetable growers and their consumers who voted for the Labor Party in 2010 based on  s commitment given precisely two years   I raise a point of order on process Is it not the form of the House that something is either accepted for tabling or not and is it 8212 The member for Hinkler will  his seat The Leader of the House has not given approval to table the  The member for Reid has the call Mr Neville interjecting 8212 Member for Hinkler I will not enter into and did not table the  I would say to them do not believe the dishonest scare campaign which is being run by those opposite Do not believe a man who suggests that whole towns will be wiped off the face of the earth Do not Senator Wong just  your seat Order Honourable senators interjecting 8212 Order When there is silence on  we will proceed Opposition Senators Opposition senators interjecting 8212 What I would say to them is do not believe the dishonest scare campaign that is being conducted 8212 The member for Hinkler has the call The point of order is not on this matter So if he sends it around we ll have a look at it The Leader of the House is leave granted The Leader of the House 8212 Leave is not granted   the member for Boothby suggested it 8212 The member will  his seat I understand he is seeking to table the  The Leader of the House is leave granted In light of  s comments   I seek leave to table an analysis for July from AGL electricity of the club s charges that shows in addition to that 8212 And members of that leagues club would be benefiting from those tax cuts Members of that leagues club would be benefiting from the family payment increases Members of that leagues club would be benefiting from the arrangements that we have The Manager of Opposition Business will  his seat Thank you very much To the member for Hinkler I say that this is a bit like the discussion we had about the Belair Hotel and the claims that were made in this parliament  The fact of course is   I rise on a point of order  was asked whether she would apologise for her broken promise to

the Consumer Credit  Amendment Enhancements Bill 2011 I would like to start by saying that I absolutely agree with Senator Williams when he talks about why Thank you for your protection   I think that those interjections are just a great example of the sort of hypocrisy we see from the Labor Party on this issue They have to think through the consequences of Order Can the member for Scullin and the member for Canning allow the member to be heard in silence I am asking both members to allow the member for Stirling the right to be heard Read the first part of your speech and compare it to Tampa There are interjections from the Minister for Scullin and I am very happy to compare it to that situation Mr Jenkins interjecting 8212 He should know better he should know better than that We are debating the Maritime Powers Bill 2012 about consolidating maritime powers at a time when the front line men and women of n Customs and Border Protection Command and their naval colleagues are operating at absolute breaking point Both Yes he should know better   I am very happy to make the comparison with the incident that the government compares this to which of course happened when the Tampa situation occurred The current situation is a very I rise today to talk about the carbon price and in particular how it impacts on part of my electoral division 8212 specifically Norfolk Island Norfolk Island is one of the most beautiful places in the Commonwealth of  It I thank all of those senators who made a contribution to this debate The Consumer Credit  Amendment Enhancements Bill 2012 continues the government s commitment to ensuring that all ns get a fair deal when they use credit In I have as indicated in my speech earlier circulated amendments to this  that go to the heart of the problems that this  now has after being watered down and curtailed by the government to the wishes of  Hanson Young you can seek leave However your amendment to schedule 1 amendment 2 will need to be put separately Must it be put separately The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN The proposed amendment 2 must be put separately to the other amendments The Greens oppose item 25 division 4 in schedule 1 in the following terms 1 160 160 160 Schedule 1 I thank the member for Canberra for her contribution because it gives me the chance to talk about what is probably the greatest island in  Magnetic Island which is off the coast of Townsville The only reason Norfolk Island This motion seeks to keep alive a debate that I suspect is running out of wind out there in the electorate That is certainly the case in the electorate that I represent I will try to respond to some of I indicate that the government does not support the seven amendments as proposed by the n Greens We believe that the  that the minister has brought forward to the Senate gets the balance right amongst all the competing interests  is that item 25 division 4 of schedule 1 stand as printed Question agreed to The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN The next question is that Greens amendments 1 and 3 to 7 on sheet 7260 be agreed to On behalf of the coalition I indicate that we also will not be supporting the Greens amendments Those Greens amendments are broadly in line if not entirely in line with some suggested amendments that were circulated by various consumer action The motion by the member for Gippsland covers many issues but I will concentrate on the part that says 8230 the carbon price will have a disproportionate impact on small businesses regional industries and regional communities 8230 There is no We have heard a lot of negativity and nonsense from those opposite with respect to this issue clearly showing once again they are the apostles of Alan Jones and the disciples of Lord Monckton About 60 per cent of our In contrast to the previous speaker I am going to speak on the  I assume that as he did not have much to say about the Maritime Powers Bill 2012 or the Maritime Powers Consequential Amendments Bill 2012 apart Oh I have been told If I am judging you incorrectly I apologise But I would urge people on  of this House to enter into a very constructive debate about what is an intractable problem to cease even Opposition Members Opposition members interjecting 8212 I move That this bill be now read a third time Question agreed to Bill read a third time I have known Greg Carroll all my life He is a typical country bloke He is a family man he is a community minded person and he was an outstanding sportsman whose family name is synonymous with n football in This Labor government is a high spending high taxing high debt and deficit government which over less than five short years in government has lost complete control of our public finances having inherited a position of no government net debt I take great pride in rising today to speak on this motion We have heard all sorts of claims coming from the opposition about what impact the price on carbon will have They have said that this will create devastation I was shocked when two of my councils were named in that list the Maranoa Regional Council based in Roma my own home town and the Western Downs Regional Council based in Dalby in my electorate They were straightaway labelled I rise to speak on the Maritime Powers Bill and Maritime Powers Consequential Amendments Bill The purpose of these  is to set out a common framework to consolidate the powers of our Commonwealth maritime enforcement agencies and their staff Once again we hear the argument that the sky is falling in I think the opposition are just desperate for this carbon price to fail Let us put some facts into this debate We hear members of the opposition time I rise to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment Cross Border Transfer Pricing Bill No 1 2012 Transfer pricing is an issue that I have a lot of interest in being an accountant and also from regional  I think I move That further proceedings be conducted in the House Question agreed to I wish to speak about  s relationship with the Republic of Serbia and the contribution that people of Serbian origin make to our vibrant multicultural community Serbia s good relationship with  has been facilitated by a significant migration Regrettably I find as I get towards the end of my parliamentary career that I am getting a bit thin skinned and I am easily provoked into debates But on this occasion it is not the member for Cook who Firstly I would like to acknowledge the presence in the gallery today of the Serbian Ambassador to  Neda Maletic Ambassador thank you for coming here today and congratulations on the fine work you are doing with the Serbian community I rise today to also contribute to the debate on the government s Tax Laws Amendment Cross Border Transfer Pricing Bill No 1 2012 which is a bill that coalition senators do not support in its current form for a I too would like to acknowledge the presence of Serbian Ambassador Neda Maletic who has been serving Serbia extremely well and has been informing the community here as well including members of parliament I also welcome the opportunity to be It is a privilege to follow the member for Cook and the member for Stirling on the Maritime Powers Bill 2012 and Maritime Powers Consequential Amendments Bill 2012 It has been interesting listening to the debate from members opposite on To my constituents of Serbian origin and to the ambassador I say dobar dan I welcome the opportunity to speak today about a country that has over the last number of decades changed advanced and developed immensely I had an I will make some small contribution to the debate on the Tax Laws Amendment Cross Border Transfer Pricing Bill No 1 2012 but before I do I note in passing how fortunate the parliament is and indeed ns are to I thank honourable members for their contribution to the debate The Maritime Powers Bill 2012 and the Maritime Powers Consequential Amendments Bill 2012 provide a simpler approach to maritime enforcement through streamlining the operational framework of our on water enforcement As the member for Stirling raised the issues of cuts to Customs I am being relevant to and to the debate When quizzed the  said it was impossible for him to give any guarantee around that Mr  I rise on a point of order relevance The parliamentary secretary is wrapping up a bill on maritime issues How that strays into comments made by a  prior to the last election is simply beyond I thank the member for Fadden The parliamentary secretary has the call and she will be as she would understand relevant to that she is summing up by leave 8212 I move That this bill be now read a third time Question agreed to Bill read a third time by leave 8212 I move That this bill be now read a third time Question agreed to Bill read a third time I recently had the pleasure of representing the at the opening of the 10 million Winnaleah Irrigation Scheme Augmentation the fourth in a suite of s completed under the n government s 140 million commitment to support the I move That orders of the day Nos 4 and 5 government business be postponed until a later hour  Question agreed to I too have significant concerns about the Tax Laws Amendment Cross Border Transfer Pricing Bill No 1 2012 in its current form It seems that the nub of the argument here is in relation to the whole issue of retrospectivity I rise to highlight the plight of the n seafood industry which is set to become the latest victim of this inept Labor government and its desperation to remain in power through yet another dodgy deal with the extreme Greens I am incredibly proud of corporate Canberra for its recent efforts in promoting organ donor awareness A firm in my electorate KazarSlaven take their social conscience seriously Led by Henry Kazar and Michael Slaven they have become a friend of Following directly on from Senator Xenophon s remarks the retrospectivity elements of the Tax Laws Amendment Cross Border Transfer Pricing Bill No 1 2012 is an admission of fault by the legislators not the taxpayers If the thing is flawed Or a promotion Yes or a promotion It is well ed 8212 and you can read the transcript of the various hearings we have had on this with one as late as last Thursday 8212 that the resources required to audit transfer pricing It is with regret that I rise today to advise the House of passing of Gunner Jack Mulholland who sadly passed away over the weekend aged 92 Jack was one of the last surviving Darwin defenders Jack manned an anti I rise to acknowledge and celebrate the Central Coast Business Excellence Awards 2012 which were held in my electorate on the Central Coast of New South Wales last Saturday night I want to acknowledge Coast Star Motors and Central Coast I rise to highlight huge concerns in the aged care sector about this government s so called reform package I have had the opportunity to meet with aged care providers in my electorate and to say they are alarmed about For 10 days every August the country meets the city at the Brisbane Ekka Each year Scouts Queensland based in Auchenflower in my electorate of Ryan participate in the Ekka s fruit display competition The fruit display is one of I received a letter from Pastor Louise Shanks from the Lakes Baptist Church at Gorokan They are involved in a program with TEAR  where TEAR stands for transformation empowerment advocacy and relief It is about contributing to aid and I present to the House a petition on public holidays which has been approved by the Standing Committee on Petitions The petition read as follows 8212 To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of RepresentativesThis petition of It was with great pride that I attended the Vietnam Veterans service on Sunday at Anzac Park in Townsville The ranks may be thinning and they may be getting a little bit tired but when the RSM called them to I recently attended Beacon events at schools in my electorate of Bass Beacon is a not for profit organisation aimed at providing brighter and positive futures for our youth The schools involved in these events in the great electorate of Order In accordance with standing order 43 the time for members statements has concluded My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency Senator Wong I refer the minister to Budget Paper No 1 which shows that the government will raise about 18 billion in carbon tax revenue I congratulate  for yet again managing to get the tactics committee to give him a head start It does not appear to be very democratic over there but he certainly does very well in terms of getting a Mr President I ask a  Is the minister also aware that the Gillard government s carbon tax burden imposed on ns is nearly 20 times larger than the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative scheme in the United States which The first point I would make in terms of cost of living is that the CPI impact is substantially less than the GST when it was introduced If those opposite are concerned about the cost of living they can explain by leave 8212 I move That further statements by indulgence in relation to Vietnam Veterans Day be permitted in the Federation Chamber Question agreed to Mr President I ask a further  The minister of course is well aware that Europe also has free permits and of course she always forgets to mention that Why is the Gillard government introducing the world s biggest This the same tired old speech that we have heard ad nauseam from those opposite the same tired old speech that we hear over and over again Why are you so intent on rolling back the tax cuts and increasing   I ask a  How can  promise those surpluses given her new promises of 2 1 billion on border protection 10 189 billion a year for an NDIS new spending of 26 billion My question is to  Will  guarantee a surplus of at least 1 5 billion this financial year and higher over the forward estimates as promised in the budget just a few weeks ago The government will bring the budget to surplus this financial year as promised We will update all of the budget figures in the Mid Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook as is appropriate I inform the House that the Minister for Housing Minister for Homelessness and Minister for Small Business will be absent from  this week for personal reasons The Minister for Families Community Services and Indigenous Affairs will answer  My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for School Education Early Childhood and Youth Senator Carr In the latest inexplicable delay in the government s response to the Gonski review of schools will the government give an unequivocal I am more than a little amazed to get this question of all  from the shadow Treasurer who has admitted 8212 even though he denies it now 8212 that the opposition have a 70 billion costing problem and their I thank Senator Milne for her question The minister for schools has indicated on a number of occasions that it is his intention to have  ready for consideration by the parliament before the end of this year The government   I ask a further  Will  now rule out the introduction of new taxes or levies or the increase of existing taxes and levies to pay for big new promises in education NDIS   I rise on a point of order as to direct relevance  was asked whether she would guarantee ruling out any new taxes or charges to pay for her spending Once again I am amazed to hear the shadow Treasurer shouting about carbon taxes given that he is a very big supporter of putting a price on carbon on the record 8212 until he decided that for the purposes of The member for Sturt is warned Order When the House is silent 8212 the member for Cook promised better behaviour today Money for people with disabilities and for schools described as a spending spree 8212 how offensive The person who was advocating a tax increase for the National Disability Insurance Scheme was Liberal Premier Campbell Newman and as is a matter The Manager of Opposition Business will  his seat  has the call Opposition members interjecting 8212 Mr President I ask a  I thank the minister for his answer but with respect every intention is not the same as an unequivocal guarantee and given the latest inexplicable delay 8212 with no explanation of why 8212 The minister for schools has indicated he will have the  ready for consideration by the parliament before the end of the year He has indicated that he is working with the states and territories as to the funding arrangements Mr President I have a further  The states say they have no money in this context so will the minister say how the is going to raise the additional 5 billion that is needed and will If I might repeat the government s intention is to talk to the states and territories about the funding arrangements to support the Gonski reforms We do have great schools in this country We want to see better schools in I thank the member for Fraser for his question Today I had the opportunity to speak to the Association of Independent Schools and I very much welcomed it I also had the opportunity to attend in front of Parliament House The member for Goldstein   I ask briefly for your indulgence In 1968 Peter Norman made a bold stand for racial equality which will be honoured in a motion in the House tonight His sister Elaine her husband Michael and his 91 My question is to the Minister for Agriculture Fisheries and Forestry Senator Ludwig Can the minister inform the Senate what the government is doing to protect  s strong biosecurity status and agricultural productivity Opposition Members Opposition members interjecting 8212 I thank Senator Moore for her continuing interest in biosecurity  s agricultural sector 8212 the farm gate 8212 contributes up to 50 billion to our national economy  s farmers not only provide us with primary production but they Mr President I ask a  Can the minister advise whether the cuts to the Queensland Department of Agriculture Fisheries and Forestry made by the Newman government will impact on biosecurity I thank Senator Moore I have read with great concern the Brisbane Times article which ed that up to 550 Queensland Department of Agriculture Fisheries and Forestry positions could be axed That amounts to about one fifth of the capacity My question is to  I refer her to the letter I have here from n Country Choice It indicates that the company is now paying a carbon charge of an extra 38 per cent for peak electricity  will  her seat The member for Mackellar on a point of order Is the Leader of the Opposition seeking to table a  That business would have seen a 50 per cent increase in their power prices and it is nothing to do with carbon pricing Presumably he has explained that to them now that the penny has dropped Presumably he would also The member for Goldstein is warned Now the Leader of the Opposition has admitted that it is the actions of state governments and others 8212 it is factors beyond carbon pricing 8212 that have led to dramatic increases in power prices To his question and to  will be relevant to  The Leader of the Opposition will  his seat The Leader of the Opposition needs to follow the rules given by the chair 8212 and the Manager of Opposition Business has indicated that there is no leave to be granted And of course the level of abuse is always correlated with their lack of ideas Honourable members interjecting 8212 The member for Mackellar will  her seat Mrs Bronwyn Bishop interjecting 8212 The member for Mackellar is warned Abuse of points of order has gone too far and will not be tolerated  is answering  In her wildest dreams that is not directly relevant to  as asked  was directly on the carbon tax 8212 An 86 per cent increase in power prices entirely as a result of the carbon 8212 Mr President I ask a further  Can the minister also advise of what joint programs in agriculture would be undermined without adequate support from the Queensland Department of Agriculture Fisheries and Forestry In answer to the Leader of the Opposition s question he has had a bit of a morning this morning He has not only gone out and threatened to cut every public school in this country he has finally come In fact Senator Macdonald should be embarrassed because the Newman government has failed to support James Cook University funding for biosecurity but there is not one word out of them about that issue What we hear is silence from the First I think it is important to get some facts on the table in relation to small business and the carbon price The truth is that there is no small business which is directly liable for the carbon price The My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer Senator Wong I refer the minister to a survey ed in today s media which finds that 66 per cent of small businesses are absorbing the impact of the government s I thank the member for Corangamite for his question Central to this government s values and principles about education is recognising that all n students need to get support in the schools they are in regardless of where they live My question is to the Minister for School Education Early Childhood and Youth It follows on from  posed to  earlier What approach will the government take and what principles will guide the government s plans Mr President I ask a  Given that the global economy is still suffering the effects of the global financial crisis and the current European debt crisis does the minister concede that imposing heavy new burdens on small business What is poor public policy is a command and control taxpayer funded bureaucratically run scheme such as the one that Senator Sinodinos has regrettably had to sign up for Senator Sinodinos has a sound public policy background I might not Mr President I ask a further  Will the minister release the modelling that underpins the answer she just gave in relation to small business including the pass through factors that have been assumed about the capacity of small The modelling to which I was referring in terms of the estimated increase of the carbon price is the Treasury modelling which has been publicly released 8212 as  well knows I do not think that there is anything My question is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation Senator Wong I draw the minister s attention to the victory the Commonwealth won in the High Court last week against tobacco companies in defence of the plain packaging  In respect of  that the member has asked me he 8212 like other members in this House 8212 knows what investment this Labor government has provided to his electorate He has got 103 million of s that have I thank the member for the  By the way I seek leave to table this photo of Mr Laming giving a Gonski The minister does not need to seek leave He can just table the  I have a  The minister has talked about improving schools across the country What will this mean for schools and students in my electorate Before I call the member for Hughes I inform the House that we have present in the gallery  the Acting Minister for Manpower and Senior Minister of State Ministry of National Development from the Parliament of Singapore Brigadier I thank  for  Yes it was a significant victory for the government and I congratulate the Attorney General 8212 the former Minister for Health and Ageing 8212 as well as the health minister for taking this And you wonder why no one believes you As I was just about to say to the member who asked  we have doubled the funding for school education That funding is indexed The way in which the index works is that it takes into account increases I am very glad that the member raises  of how best to support schools We are a government that have doubled the amount of funding going into school education And as the member should know because of the I wonder how the member who asked  feels about sitting behind this Leader of the Opposition who is coming to that school to cut its funding He has promised that today Whatever label one wants to put on The member for North Sydney is warned   I raise a point of order  cannot simply rephrase  and answer  she would have liked to have been asked like Joh Bjelke Petersen She was asked about the carbon tax The member for Gippsland is warned My question is to  I remind  that Ingleburn High School in Western Sydney has been hit with a carbon tax hike of 450 for just one month with a teacher warning So much for The member for North Sydney and the member for Dickson will leave the chamber under the provisions of section 94 a They have both previously been warned It is a double hit It is not my fault if you cannot I wonder whether the member who asked  was embarrassed to stand alongside the Leader of the Opposition at the last election and promise to cut quality teaching money promise to cut computers in schools and promise to cut   I raise a point of order In past times I have been asked to withdraw a reference to  as Lady Macbeth and I would ask her to withdraw the reference to the Leader of I could not actually hear the reference  made as I was trying to get order back in the chamber But to assist the House I will ask  to withdraw I withdraw  The Prime Minster has the call and will be heard in silence There are no further points of order on this question for a decent education and a decent life  will return to  before her The Manager of Opposition Business will  his seat  has just commenced her answer I will listen to her answer Mr President I have a  It is ed today that the ACT government will be the first government in  to stop investing in tobacco companies through its superannuation investments Does the minister believe that this decision somehow The minister can only answer that in so much as it relates to the portfolio You can t talk about Nauru and Labor leaving out the doormat Oh stop talking in the hypothetical Barnaby You don t need to be sensitive The point is that what the right legal framework 8212 the appropriate framework 8212 is for these decisions including the decisions about ESG principles ought to That is a matter for the ACT government not a matter for me That should be a matter addressed to the ACT treasurer What I can say to  consistent with what I previously said is that whatever one Mr President I ask a further  I thank the minister for her answer and I note that the same defence 8212 the thin end of the wedge argument 8212 was used by the tobacco companies in defence of I am going to take issue with the little aside which preceded  and the suggestion that somehow the government are akin to big tobacco in the argument we have used This government has led the world when it My question is to Senator Kim Carr representing the Minister for School Education Early Childhood and Youth I ask can the minister inform the Senate of the government s priorities in planning for school improvements and in school funding reform I thank Senator Crossin for her question and acknowledge her longstanding interest in education Education is this government s No 1 priority and that is why we have doubled the investment for schools since we came to office The Commonwealth Why are you making war on private schools then Why do you hate the Catholic system so much Lord Brandis you know the truth You are not committed to supporting education in this country and you have made it very clear that in your search for 70 billion education will be your No 1 priority It will be My question is to the Minister for Sustainability Environment Water Population and Communities In 2007 I secured 20 million funding for five years for the important work of rejuvenating Tuggerah Lakes Wyong Shire Council under the leadership of Mayor Bob I thank the member for Dobell for  Tuggerah Lakes has been an iconic  for many years across the Central Coast and an area iconic not only for people on the Central Coast You would not find too I will just wait for the lord highness to finish and then I will ask my question Mr President I ask a  What commitments will this government make for parents in the reforms for school funding regimes and Mr Garrett and  have made it very clear on many occasions now that no school will lose money under Labor s plan Funding for every school whether it be government independent or Catholic will continue to rise 8212 Thank you Senator Crossin In coming weeks the government will enter discussions with the states and territories on the details of the new education plan We will approach these discussions in good faith and we will expect that all Mr President I ask a further  Can the minister outline the responsibilities of state and territory governments in this national agenda of reform for schools My question is to the Treasurer Will the Treasurer update the House on the current strength of our economy and why it is important to keep investing in skills and infrastructure to keep the economy strong I thank the member for Blair for that very important question because our economy does walk tall in the world It is 10 per cent bigger than it was prior to the global financial crisis and it is stronger than My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency Senator Wong I refer the minister to the additional costs imposed on Mr Col Quast a turkey farmer in Tamworth who will pay 582 per I trust that  has recovered from the vicious attack on him by Mr Costello recently In relation to the last part of his question the answer is by the same amount as your policy but at lower cost The member for Forrest is warned To the member for Casey it may be that the example he quotes was an example used in one of today s newspapers I have seen some of those s and in some of those s we have prices referred passed through to small businesses particularly in the form of an increase in electricity and we have talked very clearly with the n community about us predicting a 10 per cent increase in household electricity  for example 8212 an My question is to  I refer  to the statement of Pat Italiano owner of Essendon Fruit Supply in the electorate of Maribyrnong who said with regard to the carbon tax We are trying to I have answered that question in relation to the carbon price impact for the relevant turkey farmer on his electricity bill If  is interested in the agricultural sector I would remind him that the government has put in Mr President I ask a  Given that the carbon tax will also increase the costs of fertiliser feed plastic bags and boxes and that it is very difficult to estimate by how much the carbon tax will increase Mr President I ask a further  Given that  s farming sector is already working in a difficult environment with rising costs a high n dollar and red tape can the minister explain why the government is so I thank the member for Capricornia for her question Of course this federal Labor government has continued to roll out its record Nation Building Program doubling the roads budget increasing the rail budget tenfold and committing more to urban public With respect to  he really is going through the motions It is the same question I have been asked time and time again I have responded and the government has responded The reality is that the intensity of My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport Will the minister update the House on the government s record investments in nation building infrastructure How are these helping to rebuild the Bruce Highway and are there any recent My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Industry and Innovation Senator Lundy Can the minister inform the Senate what the  of  s Manufacturing Taskforce released last Thursday recommends to government The non government members of  s Manufacturing Taskforce representing business unions and the research sector have produced a comprehensive  entitled Smarter manufacturing for a smarter  The  makes a strong case for the vital role I thank Senator Urquhart for her question The Gillard government is committed to ensuring that  retains a strong manufacturing industry and welcomes this  We will now carefully consider the findings of the task force and respond in detail Mr President I ask a  Can the minister outline the government s reaction to the  of  s Manufacturing Taskforce   I ask a  Minister you have talked about building infrastructure in my home state of Queensland Why is it important for us to have bipartisan support for this infrastructure and is the minister aware of Order Senator Lundy you are entitled to be heard in silence Mr President I ask a further  Can the minister advise the Senate what the government is doing to address the issues raised by the task force It would be my pleasure In addition to the leaders group the government will immediately bring together the Industry Capability Network the Buy n at Home and Abroad supply advocates AusIndustry and Enterprise Connect to share information on opportunities for Opposition Senators Opposition senators interjecting 8212 Those opposite do not like hearing what the government is doing because there is so much Reducing the energy cost of manufacturers and stimulating innovation through the 1 2 billion Clean Technology Program encouraging investment in clean technology through the The member for Sturt has just committed an own goal and he will remove himself from the chamber under standing order 94 a Persistent interjection will not be tolerated The member for Sturt then left the chamber I can assist the member for Capricornia with her very good question because we have committed some 8 7 billion for Queensland as part of the Nation Building Program In addition to that we have made commitments from the Regional That s a bit of an own goal and the 120 million commitment He said It s something I want to look at you know down the track if the Liberal National coalition get into government So there it is They want to cut school funding for those The member for Dawson is warned Given that the Cairns School of Distance Education in my home state of Queensland will according to modelling by state government and non government schools lose 4 4 million or over half of its annual funding and 3 253 other Order The minister is entitled to hear  as I am Order Senator Mason you are entitled to be heard in silence Opposition Senators Opposition senators interjecting 8212 Government Senators Government senators interjecting 8212 Mr President my question is to the Minister representing the Minister for School Education Early Childhood and Youth Senator Kim Carr Vote Liberal The member yelling out is agreeing with me I see We have been very clear about what that impact would be and the modelling has been proved to be right Small businesses are not required directly to pay the carbon Opposition Members Opposition members interjecting 8212 To the member who raises  I say that as the member would be aware we have always said that in carbon pricing the price would be paid by the big polluters there would be a flow through impact My question is to  I refer  to Geoffrey Thompson Holdings an apple and pear grower and cool store operator in my electorate whose latest electricity  show a new item carbon charges 8212 I No continue Senator Mason Is leave granted I seek your direction Mr President should I start again I am not going to join the member in this fear campaigning If she is genuinely interested in this business she would be looking at costs from all sources including the bigger electricity costs flowing from sources other than carbon   I rise on a point of order I specifically in  asked  to address what this company is going to be able to do 8212 what she is going to tell them when when he tried to pretend that all electricity price increases were somehow the fault of carbon pricing he was repudiated by state Liberals repudiated by this front bench repudiated by the regulators So today he has actually acknowledged that there The Leader of the Opposition is aware that he is not allowed to use that word No When they get things tabled they do not table them Leave not granted  is answering  I seek to present the  which identify the carbon charges for the month of July alone How about given that the Cairns School of Distance Education in my home state of Queensland will according to modelling by state government and non government schools lose 4 4 million or over half its annual funding and 3 253 She may well have said that but I hope she has also said that the Leader of the Opposition today has now acknowledged that the biggest impact on electricity prices is not carbon pricing Having finally moved from a position I thank Senator Mason for his question It has been a long time I look forward to many more  from him I will say that Senator Mason does actually care about this stuff He is actually interested That is The member for Mayo is warned Mr President I ask a  Given that according to modelling prepared by state government and non government schools more than 3 000 schools 8212 both public and private 8212 stand to lose funding under the government s new My question is to the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and Minister for Industry and Innovation How have financial markets factored in the impact of the carbon price on inflation How does this compare with the predictions that The minister is answering  and I will ask the minister to continue I will listen to the minister s answer Is this a point of order Can I indicate to Senator Mason that the statements that I have made repeatedly are that no school will lose money That is what the minister has said that is what  has said With regard to indexation Mr President I asked a very specific question 8212 now twice And that is whether funding will be cut 8212 Yes it is 8212 going to relevance I have asked directly whether in fact there will be any cuts in real terms to school funding It was a specific and direct question Is this a point of order I thank the member for Deakin for his question because underlying inflation is actually at a 13 year low and the carbon price will have quite a small impact on inflation We have stated many times in this place that Mr President I asked a very specific question Mr President I can now repeat I think for the fifth time that no school will lose money under our plans that in fact funding for every school 8212 government independent Catholic 8212 will continue to rise under our plan Honourable Senators Honourable senators interjecting 8212 Order When there is silence we will proceed Mr President I ask a further  If as  has repeatedly declared no school will lose a dollar under the new funding arrangements why has the government delayed the release of its response to

that come by sea We should note that they are trying to stop pollution and the Labor Left have managed to stop Order Senator Joyce can I bring you back to the  that is before us The Maritime  Amendment Bill 2012 is a non controversial bill It prevents pollution at sea Obviously it is an issue a lot of n ships do not have to worry about because they are already compliant within these

see a medical centre open on Abernethy Road in my electorate of Swan Belmont residents formerly serviced by the Healthpoint Belmont Medical Centre were left in the lurch after I rise to express my concern about the decision of the state government in Tasmania to allow the importation of poppy straw into Tasmania from Turkey TPI have been operating in Tasmania for eight years but have been unable to I rise to recognise the efforts of two organising committees of local festivals Over the past two weekends I have had the privilege of attending the Ormeau Lions Fair held by the Ormeau Lions Club and the Eagleby Festival held This morning on Canberra radio 2CC during a debate I had with Liberal Senator Gary Humphries talkback host Mark Parton asked us about the coalition s plan to slash thousands of jobs from the ACT and outsource an unknown number The Greens support the Maritime  Amendment Bill 2012 and the work that the government and many others have put into improving our national oceans law framework I put on the record my concern about the comments of the previous As a Queenslander one of my favourite times of the year is when the Royal Queensland Show comes to town Originally it was called the Brisbane Exhibition and it is now known as the Ekka It shows the best Queensland Earlier this week I raised the issue of poverty in regard to letters I received from Pastor Louise Shanks and young people in my electorate who were inspired to speak out about the issue of poverty and injustice in our I would like to raise an issue that is of concern to many residents of Hughes one that will adversely affect in particular residents of Revesby Panania Picnic Point East Hills and Milperra not to mention Padstow and other surrounding I rise to express my disgust and dismay at the decision of the Campbell Newman LNP government to cut off all funding to the Ipswich Tenancy Advice and Advocacy Service Every month 600 tenants will be denied the opportunity to Those opposite like to claim that our concerns about the carbon tax have been exaggerated But as part of the carbon tax this government has a plan to use taxpayers money to shut down 2 000 megawatts of coal fired Last week I had the opportunity with the Minister for School Education Early Childhood and Youth Peter Garrett to attend the opening of the trades training centre at Bonnyrigg High School We were warmly welcomed by the school principal Michael Order In accordance with standing order 43 the time for members statements has concluded Before I call  I have been asked by various groups to inform the House that tomorrow is the Day for Peace Numerous groups on indulgence 8212 earlier today it was a great honour to join Gabi Hollows many of our parliamentary colleagues and other distinguished guests to celebrate 20 years of the Fred Hollows Foundation I can see Gabi and so many of My question is to Senator Wong the Minister representing the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency I refer the minister to the repeated warnings of BHP Billiton about the effect on the viability of the Olympic Dam  of Opposition Senators Opposition senators interjecting 8212 I refer the good senator to the statement released by BHP Billiton in relation to this decision the statement his leader could not be bothered reading before he stood up at a press conference with South ns to talk about I am asked about Olympic Dam As a South n I am very happy to talk about Olympic Dam I am somewhat surprised that no South n Liberal senator wanted to ask me about Olympic Dam We have a Queenslander Senator Wong  your seat When there is silence on  we will proceed I too was happy to be with  at the launch of In Fred s Footstepsand I too wish to acknowledge to this House that Fred Hollows dream has not died and should not die Thanks to the by leave 8212 I move That further statements on indulgence on the Fred Hollows Foundation be permitted in the Federation Chamber I very much associate myself with the positive comments of  and the Leader of the Opposition My question is to  Does  agree with the Minister for Resources and Energy that the resources boom is over Mr President I ask a  I refer the minister to comments made by the resources minister Mr Martin Ferguson on AM this morning when he said You ve got to understand the resources boom is over I also On behalf of the House I welcome Gabi Hollows and other members of the foundation to the chamber today ns are certainly not to believe the Leader of the Opposition on this issue But I am very happy to answer  about the mining boom Minister Ferguson is absolutely right when he says the mining boom in terms I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question The Minister for Resources and Energy today has been talking about the prices we have been seeing for commodities He has indicated that prices have come off a bit 8212 The position of the opposition is this Please ignore what BHP has told the market Please ignore what BHP has told its shareholders Please ignore what BHP has told investors Instead believe what Tony Abbott said on The 7 30 Order When there is silence we will continue You need to refer to people in the other place by their correct title The addiction which is problematic here is the addiction to negativity of the Leader of the Opposition and those opposite I am surprised There was a time when the opposition had some senior members who represented South  and tried Mr President I ask a further  Given this government s addiction to new taxes such as the carbon tax and the mining tax ongoing division at the highest levels of the government and contradictory statements by senior ministers Opposition Senators Opposition senators interjecting 8212 We can see from the Leader of the Opposition s question that he understands absolutely nothing about our resources sector And why on earth should we be surprised This is a man who is so dangerously negative that last night   I have a  to  If as the minister for resources says the resources boom is over just seven weeks after the introduction of the mining tax then where is  She received a bill of 4 800 after a holiday in New Zealand She used her phone simply to stay in contact with the doctors specialists and social workers during her holiday and she had no idea that when she Order Senators on my right and my left Unfortunately I do not know whether or not French Telecom has any mobile services though Malcolm has shares in them But I want to thank  for her question and for her interest in n consumers This morning I My question is to the Minister for Broadband Communications and the Digital Economy Senator Conroy Can the minister provide advice to the Senate on the charges for using international mobile roaming services Does the minister have any examples of how   on a point of order  was asked a very simple question It was where is the money coming from On this side of the parliament we go to great trouble and care to understand the resources sector and understand the drivers of prosperity in our country So we can say that we factored in the minerals resource rent tax  will refer to  before the chair Mr President I ask a  Can the minister advise what actions the government is proposing to take to improve the situation for trans Tasman roaming My question is to  How is the government keeping our economy strong while making sure that all ns share in the wealth created by our natural resources Opposition Members Opposition members interjecting 8212 I thank the member for Parramatta for her question and would note that it seems quite remarkable to me that when a member in this parliament asks about a strong economy what we get from the opposition are laughter and The draft  has undertaken detailed modelling to understand the costs faced by mobile operators in providing these roaming services As I said the draft  finds that margins have been as high as 1 000 per cent and are Unfortunately ns are getting stung when they use their phones overseas not just when they go to New Zealand To address markets where we are not able to introduce coordinated regulation Senator Macdonald I am also directing the ACMA to And why s it taken you so long Stephen Mr President I ask a further  Can the minister provide advice on any initiatives to improve the situation for ns travelling to other countries My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency Senator Wong Does the minister agree that as a direct result of the introduction of Labor s carbon tax the n mining and metals production There is  of order The minister has 26 seconds remaining in which to answer  Mr President on a point of order you chastised Senator Cormann for debating the issue in his point of order but the minister is now debating  A statement was put to her Senator Cormann helpfully provided the source There are a great many things which affect the mining sector and primary amongst those are the prices paid by the world for commodities We have seen very high prices for the commodities  exports That has obviously been a In terms of the point of order I think that Senator Cormann is now saying that we should rely on the Treasury modelling Is that right This is the same Treasury modelling that he has been saying for months and Mr President a point of order in relation to the requirement for the minister to be directly relevant there was a very specific question as to whether the minister agreed or disagreed that the carbon tax would lead to significant That is debating the issue There is  of order at this stage The minister has 51 seconds remaining in which to answer  Order The Manager of Opposition Business is warned The Manager of Opposition Business will  his seat  has the call Can I suggest to the member that he does something that the Leader of the Opposition was incapable of doing before he presented for a national TV interview last night It will not take him very long it is just My question is to  I refer  to the statement from the CEO of BHP Billiton Marius Kloppers just two months ago that carbon taxes and so on have all conspired to turn this from Thank you very much   Going to the member for Sturt s point of order I grew up in South  and that is why I am personally offended by the fact that the Leader of the Opposition Again I would say that one of the primary drivers of investment in the resources sector in this country is what is occurring in global markets If policy issues such as the mining tax or the price on carbon have I am offended as someone who grew up there that he cannot take a minute of his time to read one page about something as important as Olympic Dam Every South n should be asking themselves why is it that   on a point of order the  asked a serious question and South ns expect a serious answer  should answer  about how she explains the decision that was made by BHP My question is to the Minister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism Will the minister update the House about the BHP Olympic Dam decision and  s pipeline of resources investment To assist the House   we will do a few facts The 270 million is a great achievement Opposition members interjecting 8212 I thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question As a proud South n 8212 unlike the Manager of Opposition Business the member for Sturt 8212 the last thing he would do is talk down the South n economy Let He has withdrawn   on a point of order as a fifth generation South n I demand that the minister withdraw that slur on me and my family The Leader of the Opposition will  his seat The minister has the call The facts speak for themselves 8212 270 billion an ongoing pipeline of investment creating wealth for  and perhaps more importantly creating real jobs for  Let us think about these opportunities Up at Gladstone in the hinterland there is Order The member for Mayo is warned Yes I have withdrawn The facts hurt Mr Briggs interjecting 8212 The member for North Sydney is warned 8212 that was totally inappropriate behaviour Mr President I ask a  Isn t it true to say that consistent with the government s own Treasury modelling the government fully expected that its carbon price would cause a significant decline in rates of return by The Leader of the Opposition will  his seat The minister has the call 8212 and for the benefit of the House will withdraw   on a point of order it is offensive to be accused of taking pleasure in this and the minister should withdraw I withdraw the reflection Let us be frank Olympic Dam is not lost to  The decision of BHP Billiton  was a commercial decision They have clearly indicated that in terms of the South n and n governments they The Manager of Opposition Business will  his seat The minister has the call To assist the chamber I was going to ask him to withdraw   on a point of order it is offensive to be accused of taking pleasure in what has been a tragedy for the people of South  Unlike Senator Cormann I do not decide to adopt Treasury modelling one day and then discard it the next It is fascinating he is seeking to pin me down with a tricky question by saying Do you agree with this I do draw the minister s attention to  The minister has 45 seconds remaining Mr President a point of order in relation to the requirement to be directly relevant how can the minister s abuse on this issue in response to  be directly relevant to  I am happy to take  from a Western n senator about the Olympic Dam expansion 8212 not a South n of course The South n Liberal senators are clearly not interested in the expansion of Olympic Dam which Mr President I ask a further  Why is the government so surprised that in the wake of significant increases in the cost of doing business in  as a result of the carbon tax the mining tax a I am very happy to talk about Olympic Dam As I said in answer to  from a Queensland senator Senator Brandis BHP Billiton has made very clear the reasons for the shelving of the expansion Unlike those opposite I direct my question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs Senator Bob Carr Is the minister aware that during the Howard government s Pacific solution former Labor  for international development assistance Bob McMullan heavily criticised the then government The guide for the government on the appropriate use of aid money is the OECD The OECD work on this lays down guidelines about what areas of expenditure assisting asylum seekers would be appropriately funded from an aid budget and On a point of order   I referred to the CEO of Glencore the biggest trading company in the world and one of the largest miners who said 8230  does have its risk yes We saw the I was making this point very clearly that since we announced both a carbon price and a resource rent tax investment has gone through the roof That is the truth of it The decision that has been taken by BHP I do thank the shadow Treasurer for his question because it gives me an opportunity to build on the answer that has been given by the resources minister The facts do not match the critique and they do not match My question is to the Treasurer I refer the Treasurer to the statement in London just nine weeks ago by the chief executive of Glencore the biggest commodities trading company in the world He said 8230  does have its Mr President I ask a  Under the OECD guidelines Minister what aspects of the work on the detention centres on Nauru and Manus Island can be undertaken Are they construction staffing or implementation Could you provide information on These are legitimate  and I can give  an assurance that I will share with her and the rest of the Senate the government contribution from the aid budget to anything related to this package of measures to Mr President I ask a further  Minister have you had any discussions with AusAID or the Department of Immigration and Citizenship about aid money going to Manus Island or PNG or to offshore processing as a result of My short answer is yes It is still to be clarified how OECD guidelines on the classification of aid money would have any bearing on this I would expect it to be tangential to the major government investment required to My question is to the Treasurer regarding the Reserve Bank bribery scandal The former Treasurer Peter Costello has said today that any government agency that becomes aware of evidence of criminal activity has a duty to inform the relevant minister I thank the member for Melbourne for his question because I do acknowledge there is strong community interest in ensuring that all of our public institutions meet the highest standards The government does take these matters very seriously but so My question is to Minister Wong the Minister representing the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency I refer the minister to the comments of BHP Billiton CEO Marius Kloppers in his speech to the Perth business breakfast just 11 There is  of order My question is to the Treasurer Will the Treasurer outline for the House the strength of investment underway in our economy I again refer Senator Birmingham to the statement that the Leader of the Opposition declined to read which was the announcement by Olympic Dam of this decision in which the reasons for the decision were referenced I would also refer Mr President I rise on a point of order  referred to Mr Kloppers public comments and referred to the context of the investment environment in  Senator Wong has been responding to that directly by referring to other Mr President I rise on a point of order There was one question only for a matter of direct relevance to this 8212 one question only in  I asked 8212 and that was whether the application of the Well perhaps you should let Tony Abbott know that Senator Perhaps you should let Tony Abbott know that because he is the one 8212 Order You will get the call when there is silence I apologise Mr President Mr Abbott If  knows it does not apply why does he stand next to the Leader of the Opposition while the Leader of the Opposition blames amongst other things the mining tax for the I thank Senator Birmingham who is a South n for asking  that is tangentially related to Olympic Dam 8212 I haven t seen any of your South n senators asking  Penny so third time lucky Senator 8212 third time lucky It shows how important South  is in the tactics room I am happy to discuss what Dr Kloppers has said The first quote I will give you is this the Order Minister Wong you need to refer to people in the other place by their correct titles I didn t ask about that I withdraw The Treasurer will withdraw lie I will withdraw This is a bloke who spends all his time talking about honesty and the truth but he is out there lying every day Time expired I thank the member for Fremantle for that very positive question I notice the laughter on the other side of the House because they do not appreciate the importance of the investment pipeline in our country Nor do they appreciate The Treasurer will withdraw   I ask a  The Treasurer has spoken about using facts and drawing on the experts Will the Treasurer outline why this is important Mr President I ask a  I refer the minister to the published NGERS data which indicates that the different operating entities of BHP Billiton ed more than 9 5 million tonnes of direct emissions in 2010 11 a Well what Senator Brandis and Senator Birmingham are asking ns to do is to ignore the statement from BHP to the market to the Stock Exchange to shareholders and to investors about the reasons for this and to believe their That is because it is not going to happen Our economy does walk tall in the world and one of the reasons it walks tall in the world is that we have put in place reforms for the long term reforms which are based on facts reforms which are Self evidently the Olympic Dam extension cannot be included in the figures that  has just put to me Mr President I ask a further  I now refer the minister to the email to staff from Dean Dalla Valle President of Uranium for BHP in which he described the cost of doing business in  as having My question is to the Treasurer With regard to the facts I refer the Treasurer to this statement from the Chairman of BHP just six weeks ago when he said 8230 I cannot overstate how the level of uncertainty about Order Senator Wong  your seat Honourable senators interjecting 8212 I remind honourable senators that the time to debate the issue is after  at three o clock Those on  wishing to debate it can save their Again I say if the opposition are planning are seeking are advocating the reduction of wages and conditions as one of the cost inputs they should be big enough to say so But I note they always run away when Opposition Senators Opposition senators interjecting 8212 You do not like the truth do you If the opposition are advocating for lower wages and conditions they should be honest enough to come out and tell people they are What I would say to the opposition is this 8212   on a point of order  was absolutely clear and explicit It was about the President of BHP s statement that we are not competitive Can you answer that question I was asked about the MRRT The government will absolutely continue to proceed with the MRRT in the form that we agreed with the mining industry We on this side of the House understand the importance of putting in place I will conclude on this point investment in the resources sector in this country has been growing strongly Private sector investment in our economy during our period in office totals 919 billion and investment as a percentage of GDP is My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs Senator Bob Carr Can the minister please update the Senate on n government efforts to support women and girls in developing countries around the world I acknowledge the visit of the Executive Director of UN Women Under Secretary General of the UN Ms Michelle Bachelet She was the first woman President of Chile 8212 indeed the first woman ever elected head of state in any My question is to the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and Minister for Industry and Innovation What are the facts about how the economy 8212 and business in particular 8212 is dealing with the introduction of the carbon I thank the member for Wakefield for his question The carbon price has now been in operation for seven weeks and the fact is that the economy continues to grow Yet the opposition leader who is surely the master of Mr President I ask a  Can the minister further update the Senate on n government support for UN Women  is a committed supporter of UN Women Today I announced a further n contribution of 6 7 million to support the work of this body This is specifically targeted at funding refuges counselling and legal support for women driven Mr President I ask a further  Can the minister update the Senate on  s efforts to stop violence against women in developing countries The n community has zero tolerance of violence against women AusAID is working with our partner countries to eliminate violence against women In Papua New Guinea we have established family support centres in 11 hospitals offering treatment counselling and referral My question is to Senator Wong the Minister representing the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency I also refer the minister to the decision by BHP Billiton to indefinitely defer the 30 billion Olympic Dam expansion which sees 13 The minister can answer that part of  that refers to her portfolio My question is to  I remind  that the Northern Territory parliament has unanimously passed a resolution condemning your carbon tax Can  please explain to the people of the Territory if this The member for Solomon on a supplementary The member for Mackellar will  her seat  is answering   has the call The problem for the member in following the Leader of the Opposition s campaign of deceit is that sooner or later you run straight into the facts The Leader of the Opposition was out there  preaching doom and gloom No   I seek leave to table the motion that was put to the Northern Territory parliament and was unanimously passed condemning Julia Gillard 8212 The member for Solomon

given at May Senate Estimates 3 a The department was asked the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations upon notice on 25 June 2012 With reference to the decision of Senior  SDP Richards of Fair Work  in the case CFMEU v Brookfield Multiplex Australasia Mr President I ask a  I take from the minister s answer that revenue over the forward estimates from this tax are under threat Will the minister now admit that the government made a mistake in its deal With respect to Senator Milne I do not propose to traverse again what occurred in the context of the passage of the MRRT I think the arguments for and against that amendment were traversed in that debate and I am Mr President I ask a further  I thank the minister but given the obvious need for increased government revenue to fund reforms such as Gonski education the National Disability Insurance Scheme and Denticare will the government now agree My question is to Senator Wong the Minister representing the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency Does the minister agree with  s advice to Victorian fruit packing business Geoffrey Thompson Holdings which has been hit with My

carrying out of your duties today On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Thank you   I take pleasure in joining in the debate on the Veterans Affairs  Amendment Bill 2012 As other speakers from this side of the chamber have indicated the  proposed by the government makes a I rise today to discuss how much this Labor government s toxic carbon tax is hurting local business and in particular local business in the Calare electorate The shadow Treasurer and I recently visited businesses in Calare to talk about Order Through the chair Senator Fierravanti Wells Minister you know that it is wrong Let me tell you this Senator Ludwig interjecting 8212 I withdraw lie and replace it with fabrication Let me tell you why it is a fabrication It is misleading it is wrong and I rise to speak on Health Insurance Amendment Extended Medicare Safety Net Bill 2012 The Extended Medicare Safety Net established by the previous coalition government assists thousands of ns with high out of hospital medical expenses For those who have That is wrong That is an absolute lie and you know it Minister Ludwig I move That government business order of the day No 2 Social Security  Amendment Fair Incentives to Work Bill 2012 and No 5 Customs Amendment Anti dumping Improvements Bill No 2 2011 and related  be postponed to the He cut 1 billion will negate all the benefits that are in here I will withdraw for the expediency of the House The member for Denison back in October 2011 also spoke in favour of this measure   I ask the member to withdraw that statement That is an unusual interjection from a preposterous fool The member for Denison back in October 2011 also spoke in favour 8212 Order The member for Paterson has the call As I said before I was interrupted the member for Denison back in 2011 also spoke in favour of these measures 8212 again this will be an opportunity to vote for what he has previously said instead of just blatantly Order What is your point of order The member for Kennedy will get his time to speak shortly   I rise on a point of order Some of us do want to know whether voting for the opposition s amendment 8212   as I understand it that gratuitous insult was directed at me and I want an apology I rise to speak on the Veterans Affairs  Amendment Bill 2012 This bill seeks to make some minor measures and amendments to  affecting our veterans and ex servicepeople Most importantly seeks to clarify the arrangements regarding The statement has been withdrawn as has been requested by the House Mr Katter interjecting 8212 The member for Kennedy will get his time to speak very shortly I rise on a very sad note this morning to talk about the death of Joan Margaret Bielski nee Ward who passed away at the age of 88 on Friday 17 August 2012 She was a feminist and activist to I rise to promote the great community work done by Lifeline and to act as ambassador for this noble cause For the past 49 years Lifeline has been at the forefront of suicide prevention now boasting 43 Lifeline centres and As many constituents in my electorate of Deakin would know Taralye is a centre for deaf children It provides oral language training especially for young children It also provides services to hearing impaired children right through to the age of 18 August 2012 marked the 46th anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan and as many of us would know 50 years since the first n troops arrived on Vietnam s soil in 1962 Commemorative ceremonies were held across our As a member representing an electorate with a large number of public servants I rise to speak about the employment of Indigenous ns in the n Public Service The government has set a target to increase Aboriginal and Torres Strait That s not right Bob No You have made your point of relevance I am not going to allow the member for Fadden to enter into debate I volunteered to go to Indonesia as a lad of 18 We had to give out three telephone numbers and we were on 24 hour call up to go over there I want to make the point that I do The honourable member said that that is not right Well I wish somebody on his side would explain it to us If people are of limited ability intellectually they do not like taking interjections I understand that But if you Order The member for Kennedy will  his seat The member for Fadden on a point of order Standing order 90 requires that a member not impugn a motive upon another member The member for Kennedy cannot say of another member that they have limited intellectual abilities No I am stating that he cannot impugn the other member he was speaking about I retract that I apologise for saying limited intellectual abilities There are three options and I think that most people probably understand this It can be indexed on male average weekly earnings 27 7 per cent on the CPI or   a point of order on relevance you cannot equate it with the Malaysia solution Secondly I misspoke 8212 We are simply asking these people 8212 they are not going to tell us obviously we ask for some information and we cannot get it off them But as we understand the implications of what they are doing these benefits No the member does not have the call the member for Kennedy has the call I am simply responding as the opposition spokesman in this area Does the member for Fadden wish to raise a point of order We come in this place to debate to reach an intelligent consensus I asked the opposition spokesman a reasonable question and I got by way of reply a gratuitous insult Let him reflect upon whether this place is a place Are you saying that you have been personally 8212 I would like to update the House on an issue of major and immediate importance to my electorate of Tangney Section 8 of Roe Highway is a much needed extension to an arterial road link in the WA transport network When we think about what makes a city liveable safe and reliable public transport services are among the top of the list But among Geelong s six train stations we have what I would say has to be one of I thank senators for their contributions to the debate on this bill I also thank Senator Fierravanti Wells for her contribution Although I am not sure it stayed relevantly close to we do have wide ranging  I rise to update the chamber on my ongoing campaign for a Manning Road on ramp to be built in my electorate of Swan It was interesting listening to the parliamentary secretary talk about his train station I welcome him Order In accordance with standing order 193 the time for constituency statements has concluded I am indebted to the Chinese writer Ma Jian whose novel Beijing Coma was recently published for his commentary in today s n on the trial and conviction of Gu Kailai the wife of the Chinese Communist Party boss Bo As there have been no amendments circulated it is my intention to call the minister to move the  unless any senator wishes to move into the Committee of the Whole There being no such request I call the I move That this bill be now read a third time Question agreed to Bill read a third time Last night I admit that I was taken unawares because Senator Mason uncharacteristically and shockingly did not use his full 20 minutes That is why I was caught on the hop I broadly support this bill and I am glad The coalition welcome the opportunity to support the Customs Amendment Smuggled Tobacco Bill 2012 but it is important to note that has been debated in the wake of the Labor government s inconsistent and incompetent handling of this I thank all of those who have contributed to this debate I am not sure that I can agree with everyone obviously because as the member for Kennedy rightly points out if the proposal of the opposition were passed it  is that the amendment be agreed to  now is that this bill be now read a second time Question agreed to Bill read a second time Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced ns and human beings are exchanging more and more information online and that of course leads to a greater prevalence of cybercrime It is a threat to all internet users from businesses to home users meaning anyone can fall victim I would like to thank those senators that contributed to the debate on the Cybercrime  Amendment Bill 2011 Senator Brandis asked about the government s response to the  of the Joint Select Committee on Cybersafety and the committee  is that the  amendment moved by Senator Ludlam be agreed to by leave 8212 I move That this bill be now read a third time Question agreed to Bill read a third time Superannuation has changed the way many people save for their retirement It is easy in our younger years not to think far into the future and make decisions that will have an impact when our working lives come to an I call the member for Aston I rise to support the Customs Amendment Smuggled Tobacco Bill 2012 creates new offences for smuggling tobacco products and for conveying or possessing smuggled tobacco products I was very pleased that the Attorney General announced this on World The Superannuation  Amendment MySuper Core Provisions Bill 2011 follows the Cooper review into  s superannuation system and has the aim of introducing a new low cost superannuation product known as MySuper to replace existing default superannuation fund products I move At the end of the motion add but the Senate calls on the Government to initiate a review of the Criminal Code Act 1995 to examine the strengthening of the offences in that Act to ensure that they  is that the  amendment moved by Senator Xenophon be agreed to He is just like the member for Wannon The member for Solomon is doing a great job So it is fantastic to get that endorsement from her I rise today to speak on the Customs Amendment Smuggled Tobacco Bill 2012 which as stated by the  the Thank you I trust the self praise does not continue with the next speaker That could happen between the member for Makin and the member for Fowler but we probably should get on with  which is that the It is the Midas touch in reverse as the member for Solomon says It is quite remarkable Then they think that they have to do something about this so they had better toughen up on the offences in this area The Midas touch in reverse The member for Wannon might choose to address himself to before the House It is very kind of my dear friend the member for Solomon to say that I am a dedicated hardworking member Thank you Later in life I might be delighted to use that as a reference because the member for No I am the member for Wannon Mr  I am sure the member for Aston is busy somewhere working on behalf of his constituents 8212 he being a very dedicated hardworking local member Retiring with dignity after a lifetime s effort and contribution should not be a luxury reserved for a few Thanks to successive Labor governments and their vision for the future to introduce enhance and defend the superannuation guarantee for all I table a supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the government amendments to be moved to this bill The memorandum was circulated in the chamber on 13 September 2011 I seek leave to move the amendments together Leave granted I move Senator Ludlam if these are technical amendments and everyone is in agreement we will put them and then I will allow you to ask your general  So I put that amendments 1 and 3 to 6 on sheet BL210 Likewise the n Greens believe these amendments are being provided by way of consistency so we will not be opposing them I did have some general  on but the minister got the jump on me as is Can I indicate that these amendments are of a technical character which the opposition supports I have two  and the first is essentially about definition The European convention quite exhaustively defines traffic data whereas my understanding is that this bill relies on the parent act and does not use convention terminology I would be It does seem to go to the difference in the phrases between the T IA Act which sets out information or s that relate to communication and the phrase in the convention which if you will bear with me seems Minister I trust that you or your advisers have a copy of the parent act with you Could you point out to me in the definition section of the T IA Act where I can find the standard definition that It is 276 of the Telecommunications Act Minister I will look that up and that might give rise to a  but while I am doing that my question effectively is are we defining this term in the negative in that it refers to everything except It may depending on the nature of the communication You can imagine a circumstance where locational data is not part of the communication You can imagine where it is so it would depend on the circumstances But the way it Would that include location specific data Does that get incorporated 8212 so latitude longitude or however the device I p that a phone would be included in your earlier definition under the convention of a computer device Will that include I think the simple way to put it is that it is everything about the communication not the communication itself That is helpful and with a minimum of back and forth you have answered my question In essence this will refer to anything at all apart from the communication itself I suppose it would make more sense to come to As I understand it the part of the work that the PJCIS national security inquiry is dealing with is encryption So as it stands has left the broader issue around encryption and the issue I think you raise I have  before I move the first of the set of Greens amendments why did it take a year I am not satisfied with the minister s explanation for why this is happening now it is cutting diagonally Competing for legislative space is always a challenge particularly in the Senate but more importantly it does require industry consultation It has required significant consultation backwards and forwards to ensure that industry understands the role that this  will play I also welcome the opportunity to briefly speak on the Customs Amendment Smuggled Tobacco Bill 2012 Firstly I want to respond to some of the comments made by the member for Wannon He asserted that as a result of the I rise today to speak on the Superannuation  Amendment MySuper Core Provisions Bill 2011 which will be another delivered election promise from this Labor government is all about providing a simple clear superannuation alternative for thousands of We are here now All right then I guess I will have to be satisfied with that as an explanation as to why this is occurring when of course it should be folded into the process the joint committee is The government does not agree to further expanding the role of the Ombudsman through this amendment gives the Ombudsman power to inspect each of the preservation notices each instrument of revocation and each evidentiary certificate relating to a I move government amendment 7 on sheet BL210 7 Schedule 1 page 21 after line 14 at the end of the Schedule add 34 Transitional provision for item 18 8212 ongoing domestic preservation noticesDespite the insertion of section 107H into With the government having substantially adopted the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Cyber Safety in the amendments which it proposes to move later in this debate the opposition is satisfied that the safeguards are sufficient and for that  is that n Greens amendment 3 on sheet 7143 be agreed to Question negatived I want to reiterate what I said in my  speech The opposition is concerned at the insufficiency of consultation with carriers and carriage service providers and the relatively brief period which they will have to alter their arrangements The n Greens will support this government amendment I think Senator Brandis indicated this is an improvement over the original drafting of What we learned from telcos and ISPs during the original inquiry last year was just how As the member for Leichhardt I have taken a very keen interest in measures to control illegal tobacco I actually grew up in Mareeba which was one of the largest tobacco producing regions in  In fact one of my As I understand it within the legislative system that service providers operate under they can already charge a law enforcement fee so it comes back to whatever the costs are They are then returned to the particular law enforcement agency I thank the minister for his answer So effectively this will just add whatever additional costs there are relating to data retention to the existing costs that telcos can levy on or request be recovered from the law enforcement agency I think Senator Ludlam has mixed two issues again It is in relation to what would in part be within the warrant So it is not retention I indicated during the summing up speech that the retention issue has been Minister correct me if I am wrong or if I am using language that is too broad My understanding is that one of the things this bill is bringing about is effectively targeted data retention So the matter that has The importance of this measure 8212 and let us recognise it 8212 is that the state cannot afford in years to come for measures like this not to pass the House We have to assist that section of our community Order The member for Banks has the call The House was affording the member for Banks quite a wide range there but the member has belatedly thrown a life saving ring towards the topic that he is supposed to be speaking about I recognise his dexterity there and The Superannuation  Amendment MySuper Core Provisions Bill 2011 which we are debating today represents the essence of Labor Party values 8212 a fair go for all The 2009 ALP platform states in its preamble Through the good times and You invite me to say yes but the targeted protection of the content of the communication is what we are aiming for It is not the general retention of data So I do think we are talking about different things Minister in order to be completely clear about the operation of let us say that we are talking about someone who is a target of a particular investigation who meets the thresholds for a stored communications warrant or This is where technical issues really come to the fore But as you understand of course metadata can take different forms depending on the nature of the communication 8212 whether it be an email whether it be an SMS or Thank you Minister that is helpful So with something like an email the recipient of the email and the time that I wrote it by necessity would be preserved You are not asking telcos to do anything that they are I know that you were contemplating it because you have referred precisely that for the entire n population over to the PJC however that is a debate for another day That may explain why there is no direction in the You are not opening up a chink there when you say at this stage to suggest that we may be contemplating it In relation to this  the short answer is no I want to deal with the amendment in total The government does not agreed to the creation of an exemption regime regarding compliance with preservation notices Proposed amendment 4 goes to the same issues as the proposed stored communication amendments By way of closing out this section of the debate I think the minister is making a grave mistake What penalties would apply to an ISP that failed to hand material over within the statutory time frame I suspect you are not proposing an amendment for sanctions There is no sanction What we do is work cooperatively with the ISP to obtain the information that we can I am very pleased to speak on the Customs Amendment Smuggled Tobacco Bill 2012 In beginning my remarks I take issue with one of the opening remarks of the member for Leichhardt in which he characterised the government s approach There is no penalty So what happens to a service provider that fails to hand material over on time if there is no penalty Do you ask them again do you seek a statement of reasons would you give them an extension of time  is that n Greens amendments 4 1 and 2 on sheet 7143 be agreed to Question negatived I rise to speak in support of the Superannuation  Amendment MySuper Core Provisions Bill 2011 Can I begin by commending the member for Banks for his contribution to the debate on this  He has summed up the issues by leave 8212 I move together government amendments 8 to 11 on sheet BL210 8 Schedule 2 item 27 page 29 lines 9 and 10 omit paragraph 15D 3 b substitute 160 160 b the offence 160 160 160 160 These amendments reflect recommendations made by the Joint Select Committee on Cyber Safety They are appropriate amendments and the opposition supports them The Greens will of course support these amendments because without them the  would be completely redundant The minister was being a little coy This is a drafting error that would have invalidated the entire purpose of 8212 Can I rephrase it I do not think I am crushing your expectations in relation to the  I think it is  that goes to a very worthwhile purpose that you ultimately do support To deal with the threshold Minister can you describe for us why the government believes it is appropriate for these enormous volumes of data to be disclosed not just to ASIO and not just to the AFP but also to welfare agencies the tax office I think we are mixing two issues I will say it again for the record Under this  it is only accessible for lawful purposes of enforcing criminal law protecting public revenue and enforcing pecuniary penalties But this is about It is a pleasure to rise and follow the member for Makin who I think captured so well the Labor principles and policies we have introduced and why we have introduced them into superannuation reform I too rise to speak I will acknowledge the minister s point that this is a bigger issue I think you said it is a completely separate issue I do not take that on But it is bigger than the nature of that I would like to acknowledge the member for Capricornia and other speakers the members for Hindmarsh and Makin who talked about the Customs Amendment Smuggled Tobacco Bill 2012 in the context of the range of things the government is trying I think I am going to disappoint you again The difficulty with what you are proposing is first that I would never countenance something on the fly where we have not had an opportunity of looking at the implications of Senator Ludlam as you rightly and generously point out I represent the one party in this chamber that cares about the rights of the individual I am a little constrained in being able to respond directly to you because I I thank both the minister and the  for their contributions I respect that Senator Brandis does not want to prejudice the outcome of a live inquiry on which I would have preferred to have been the crossbench senator  is that n Greens amendments 1 to 10 on sheet 7232 be agreed to I am honoured to rise today to commemorate the 70th anniversary of Bomber Command Between 1940 and 1944 the Royal Air Force s Bomber Command provided the only Allied strategic attack capability against German forces on the Western Front and Senator Ludlam as I said a moment ago I think you do make a good point and can I assure you that the point you make 8212 and which I assume you have made in your submission to the Parliamentary I would like to thank all the members who have participated in this debate In particular the contribution by the member for Newcastle captures a lot of what this bill is all about This bill delivers on the government s I thank the minister for his contribution  is that be now read a second time Question agreed to Bill read a second time On indulgence I rise to speak on  s greatest maritime tragedy an event that is still not widely recognised in our nation But following the commemoration of its 70th anniversary at the n War Memorial in July this year by leave 8212 I move Greens amendments 5 to 8 on sheet 7143 together 5 Schedule 2 item 41 page 32 after line 13 after paragraph 180A 5 a insert ab

provisions of section 29TB 2 Schedule 1 item 9 page 9 I think this is the first occasion I have had the honour to address you as Acting  and Temporary Chairman Senator Sinodinos The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN And I hope you will behave accordingly Indeed I will having been long In case this exchange between Senator Brandis and me is having the impact of moving the government towards the position of supporting our amendments I will put a few brief remarks before I seek the views of the minister I I feel very humbled to follow the member for Kingsford Smith on this very sombre indulgence but I feel obliged to make a contribution as well It is a statement in honour of the unveiling of the memorial commemorating  Ludlam it remains my view that the special provision which the government s amendment makes in relation to the use of data in the prosecution of capital crimes 8212 that is the requirement of the Attorney General s fiat I will not canvass the issues that Senator Brandis argued I think they are correct and they are the reason the government also does not support the amendments moved by Senator Ludlam In addition I would add for the record At the outset I say that I do acknowledge the quality of the advocacy of the member for Dunkley but that there are some concerns I have to express The opposition has moved three substantive amendments The first opposition amendment  is that the amendments moved by the member for Dunkley be agreed to The Greens will also be supporting these amendments although we do not believe that go far enough I will briefly put some comments on the record as to why The final amendment on the running sheet from the n Greens As the minister says these amendments reflect measures which improve safeguards and accountability mechanisms within the scheme of the  in response to recommendations of the Joint Select Committee on Cyber Safety and for that reason they have the opposition The government does not support the amendment In part the committee s recommendations expressed concern about the handling of personal information by foreign countries The government does share that concern It is clear that retains all the existing I cannot let the opportunity pass without calling attention to the bizarre paradox that these concerns about the effect on privacy of the leaking of information come from  who is the principal apologist in  for the egregious by leave 8212 I move amendments 1 to 5 together 1 Schedule 1 page 3 after line 2 after Part heading insert Corporations Act 20011A At the end of subsection 1017B 1A Add 160 160 and c without limiting paragraph The Greens amendments seek to prohibit moving an individual s investment from a tailored MySuper product into another without their consent This

government amendments 1 to 6 on sheet BG233 as circulated together Leave granted I move amendments 1 to 6 on sheet BG233 1 I cannot help but take the bait 8212 I thought you might as I p Senator Brandis was hoping that I would and draw the distinction which appears to have escaped Senator Brandis that the threshold of transparency that we apply to states for obvious reasons is qualitatively and quantitatively different to Government amendments 1 3 4 5 and 6 relate to delaying the start date of the  from 1 October to 1 January 2014 The coalition views this as a sensible move and will

pleasure to speak on behalf of the coalition on the Greenhouse and Energy Minimum Standards Bill 2012 and to offer our support for it Our points in relation to this bill are very simple With regard I move That this bill be now read a third time I want to follow up on a few of the comments that the honourable member for Mallee made I saw that that was a difficult contribution for him to make I could feel it You said that a memorial should I trust that is due respect being shown to the chair from the other side of the chamber It is a pleasure to speak on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Independent Expert Scientific Committee on Coal Seam Gas I am not sure if I have yet had the pleasure Mr Acting  Sinodinos of noticing you in the chair

years a constant first pushed by the Liberal Premier from Western  and then followed by Liberal Premiers in Victoria New South Wales and Queensland 8212 a I am sure the member for Blair will be

circumstances which even today are shrouded in some Mr Acting  Sinodinos I too add my congratulations as a fellow New South Wales senator on your new position as an acting  I rise today to relay to the Senate another chapter in the sad and The coalition has a good record of caring for the environment while restricting green tape The coalition does this through coordinated considered policies rather than through the incongruous group of complex and inconsistent schemes that have blown out of control The revised Murray Darling Basin Plan released earlier this month cannot deliver a healthy future for the Murray Darling Basin s rivers in New South Wales The plan still falls short of ensuring the long term survival of the rivers I speak in support of the Greenhouse and Energy Minimum Standards Bill 2012 and the Greenhouse and Energy Minimum Standards Registration Fees Bill 2012 To put this debate into context I want to quote directly from the Senate Environment and Like the member for Makin I am very pleased to speak on the Greenhouse and Energy Minimum Standards Bill 2012 and the Greenhouse and Energy Minimum Standards Registration Fees Bill 2012 These  for me push three important buttons The I rise in today s matters of public interest debate to speak about an issue of vital importance to my home state of Tasmania and that is the GST Before I begin my contribution I

There is  of order The minister has 59 seconds remaining to address  In fact I answered the 8212 Mr President on a point of order Senator Wong continually refers to senators on this side particularly Senator Brandis by the incorrect title As someone who has been the most precious outspoken and glass jawed minister that has ever been Order Mr President on a point of order Senator Wong merely seeks to recognise Senator Brandis s position as a member of royalty and the demeanour which he brings associated with that and I am sure it is meant as a Order That is not a point of order I remind honourable senators on  that when referring to members of this place or the other the correct title of the appropriate person must be used on  and Given Senator Brandis demands that we call the British government Her Majesty s government I did not think he would be offended by the term Her Majesty But if he is I will not call him Her Majesty whilst I Mr President on a point of order with respect you cannot allow this minister to defy your authority as she continually does Having ruled the last point of order out of order you are now entertaining a minister answering a There is  of

programs like the National Disability Insurance Scheme massive increases to school I inform the House we have present in the gallery  a former Speaker of the House the honourable Neil Andrews and Mrs

not see from the shadow Treasurer over there or I am I am referring to taxation I am referring to our commitment to keep the tax to GDP ratio below the level that we inherited from those opposite who were the highest taxing government in our history I am We have a proven track record of making room for Labor priorities such as our Paid Parental Leave scheme Those opposite want to put tax up to

honourable senators the presence in the chamber of a parliamentary delegation from the National Assembly of the Seychelles led by the Speaker the Hon Dr Patrick Herminie MP On behalf of all senators I My question is to Minister for Broadband Communications and the Digital Economy Senator Conroy Can the minister provide the Senate with advice on how other countries are addressing the need for broadband How do they vary from the approach being Merci Monsieur President Vive la France I thank  for her question and for her interest in broadband policy Countries all around the world recognise the economic importance of broadband infrastructure but progress on delivering high speed broadband is Mr President I ask a  Is the minister aware of any alternative proposals for the n government to

Commissioner s  into the treatment of women in the n Defence Force I thank the member for Page and acknowledge her longstanding interest in Defence matters The n Human Rights Commission  into the treatment of women in the ADF was tabled in the House this morning The Sex Discrimination Commissioner who Mr President I ask a further  Is the minister aware of any further details of the alternative policies The member for Wentworth edly told the Financial Review this week that he has a fully costed policy ready to go You might ask why on earth wouldn t Mr Turnbull release it now Why is he saying that it My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency Senator Wong I refer the minister to her answer to my question on Monday where she said that free permits would reduce the cost impact I raise a point of order The opposition has given this minister all the latitude in the world As Senator Collins just pointed out in her interjection there is only one second left in the answer The only thing that That was not relevant to what I just said but 8212 Mr President I do not think they are interested in the answer because they are continuing to interject Order Yes it was Mr President from time to time you have recourse to quoting rulings of former Presidents Former Presidents never had the sessional order which required compliance to direct relevance Therefore with great respect yet again Mr President the coalition makes this But you can sit her down I cannot instruct the minister how to answer  Mr President I rise on a point of order Earlier this week the minister asserted that free carbon permits would reduce the cost of the carbon tax impact on exporting businesses I asked a very specific question how many of Thank you Mr President I am simply making the point that there are a range of prices and taxes in the economy and that those opposite profess to care about business but in fact were to combine with Bob Brown So the answer is relevant but I am not I had ruled that I cannot instruct the minister how to answer  That is consistent with the way this chamber has been ruled over a long period of time I am aware of the sessional order that you Thank you Mr President Perhaps I could be of assistance by explaining how the program works The program works by way 8212 Opposition senators interjecting 8212 I am glad to hear that is where you are getting your advice from Senator Senator Wong actually answered  and perhaps s opposite did not hear it because Senator Cormann who asked  continually shouts across Order I still have one second remaining on the clock Tony Sheldon was right On the point of order it is of no consequence whether Senator Brandis thinks he has given Senator Wong enough latitude While his personal views are of course of interest they have no relevance to how the Senate is conducted On one second Seriously What I can indicate is that 8212 Order Go on Minister continue to answer  Order Interjections do not help Minister you have got four seconds If I could perhaps answer  rather than just have 8212 Opposition senators interjecting 8212 Order Order As I have said on numerous occasions I cannot instruct the minister how to answer  You may well have an answer to  fixed in your mind but I 8212 Senator Abetz interjecting 8212 Wait a Order Senator Wong your comments should be addressed to myself as the chair and not across the chamber Senator Wong continue My question is to  I refer  to this electricity bill from Dunlop Park Memorial Pool in the electorate of Moreton which shows that their power costs have increased by 1 200 as a direct I will come to  Senator If they are interested in talking about 8212 The program works by establishing eligibility and baselines and those are worked through by the department with industry including with the independent expert advisory panel Firms would then need to apply for eligibility under the program in accordance with those Come to  now How many Come to  You are required to be directly relevant Well certainly not as many as would have received a tax cut if those opposite had not indicated that they would vote with the Greens to oppose a tax cut Let us remember that those opposite if they are interested You don t like the fact that I am on my feet do you Opposition Members Opposition members interjecting 8212 First we will check the facts because our experience this week is that the opposition s campaign of falsity includes  that it comes into this parliament and asks Facts have been wrong in  all week 8212 things misrepresented Yes the fools in the opposition think that laughing loudly changes a fact But that is a fact and no amount of laughing or overacting changes that fact Fact No 2 we have always said that there would be some I seek leave to table the electricity bill so that it may assist  Leave not granted My question is to the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency Is the minister aware of the exciting work being done by MBD Energy and others at James Cook University and the Tarong Power Station in relation to the The member for Goldstein is warned I thank the member for New England for his question I am aware of MBD Energy and James Cook University s cooperation on this issue In fact the government recently announced through my colleague the Minister for Resources and Energy of the type of innovative  that can make a difference and help us establish a clean energy future for this country MBD Energy is in fact at the forefront of the biofuels industry It has s across a wide Mr President I ask a  Given the finding by the TD Securities Melbourne Institute monthly inflation gauge that due to the introduction of the carbon tax from 1 July the price of electricity rose by 14 9 per I thank the member for his question The n economy is the strongest developed economy in the world We have impressive growth we have low unemployment and we are outperforming every other major advanced economy Unemployment at 5 2 per As I said in my earlier answer which it appears they did not hear because they were so busy shouting I am not able to give the precise numbers of each firm within each industry I am not able to My question is to the Treasurer Will the Treasurer outline for the House  s strong jobs record Why is it important that we invest in education and training to keep this record strong The minister s answer raises a further  Why is the Gillard government so intent to press ahead with the world s biggest carbon tax when it imposes an increased cost burden on 23 million ns which is five With respect Mr President I do not think there was  in that That was the same rant to be frank we have heard for two years so I am not sure how I can be directly relevant to Honourable Senators Honourable senators interjecting 8212 As I said I went through  for about the 50th time in this chamber about how the assertion by the opposition about the imposition of this tax is incorrect  the Climate Commission went through the number of nations Order When we have silence on  we will proceed My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer Senator Wong Does the minister recall in March this year the Treasurer Mr Swan said that refunding mining companies for increases in state royalties would not change any of the mining My question is to  I refer  to this electricity bill from FoodWorks Burpengary in my electorate that shows their off peak power has increased by 80 per cent as a direct result of the Mr President I rise on a point of order on proper titles It is about Senator Brandis Minister Wong continues to throw what is an acerbic comment and one that we know full well she is not capable of taking Thank you As I previously indicated the budget estimates were 13 4 billion as  has indicated That was a revision down in the first three years and we will update 8212 Time expired All roads lead back to Mathias I thank the member for his question To the member s question I would remind him of the facts and no amount of fear campaigning from the opposition changes the facts as inconvenient as they are for the opposition So The member for Goldstein might be listening from the outside of the building soon He would represent people with families who have seen an increase in their family payments and will see one again from this government from the proceeds of the Minerals Resource Rent Tax because we believe in sharing the benefits of Is the member for Longman seeking to table a  I do seek leave   This electricity bill shows in black and white the increase The member for Longman will  his seat The Leader of the House has indicated that leave is not granted The member for Petrie has the call I have no response to that It is 8212 Honourable senators interjecting 8212 When there is silence we will proceed Senator Milne is entitled to hear the answer We have a 65 billion debt to pay off I get called much worse than that by you Honourable senators interjecting 8212 Order When there is silence we will proceed Senator Collins Give your pay back You re a thousand bucks a word Oh so a state Liberal mining tax is fine is it Her Majesty but a Commonwealth profits based tax that delivers to ns That s bad This is an extraordinary proposition Anyway I return to  from Senator Milne It is the case as has been ed that the Treasurer has written to the state treasurers on the issue of royalties to remind them of the government s position in relation to increases in royalties As the Senate may Order Senator Wong That just makes my point Maybe Senator Joyce cannot hear the nature of some of the interjections up this end but for him to be making that point absent what we all hear coming across the chamber from the other I have to say I anticipated this question from Senator Cormann but I thank Senator Milne 8212 There is  of order but I do remind as I did earlier that honourable senators need to refer to people in both this place and the other place by their correct titles The minister has nine seconds remaining First it is the case 8212 Opposition senators interjecting 8212 The ruling was that the minister will answer  and not engage in irrelevancy such as contrasting the government and the opposition I put it to you that the Minister for Health is engaging in the irrelevancies 8212 We have smashing outsourcing and we have outsourcing What you see when you outsource health to Queensland are cuts We have seen cuts to Breastscreen Queensland We have seen ed cuts of 80 million to hospital services in Brisbane We The minister will not use props bids in Bundaberg Hervey Bay Maryborough and Toowoomba but it is all of a piece Queensland did not want those beds under Campbell Newman because this Leader of the Liberal Party when he was health minister cut 1 billion out The Manager of Opposition Business has the call   I rise on a point of order and draw your attention to the ruling of the Speaker in 1981 which was that the minister will 8212 Government members interjecting 8212 You don t believe in precedence The minister will  her seat The Manager of Opposition Business on a point of order and smashing the very services that deliver better after hours care better access to psychological services 8212 The member for Dickson I thank the member for Petrie for that very important question I have to say that by and large the Commonwealth and the states have worked very well and very cooperatively together on health reform In fact last year we My question is to the Minister for Health Will the minister update the House on the s partnerships with the states and territories to deliver health and hospital services for ns Why is state cooperation vital in making The minister will no longer use the prop The Manager of Opposition Business will  his seat I have heard  The minister has the call I am sure Senator Milne will not be surprised that my answer is no The government has made its position in relation to this very clear The government as the Treasurer has indicated does have a view about resolving this does assume cost pass through My question is to  I refer  to this power bill from Michael and Melissa Farrant dairy farmers in Murray that shows an increase of 15 per cent in their power bill because of the It s not a household Thank you Mr President In relation to the last bit I was responding to a number of aspects of  If  only wants to ask one aspect I am quite happy not to take multibarrelled  which  was broader than that The minister is answering  and the minister does have 23 seconds still remaining to answer  Mr President I rise on a point of order on relevance The minister was specifically asked whether or not she agreed with  that the fruit packing business should pass on its additional costs caused by the carbon As we have previously discussed in this place on a number of occasions there have been substantial increases in electricity prices for some years The vast majority of those have occurred as a result of investment in poles and wires Order I remind senators that interjections across the chamber are

ask honourable senators to stand in silence to signify their assent to the motions Honourable senators having stood in their places 8212 Question agreed to I will only speak briefly at this time

speak on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Independent Expert Scientific Committee on Coal Seam Gas and Large Coal Mining Development Bill 2012 While the Greens will be supporting this bill because it does take us Excuse me I am Of course there are some exceptions I might mention Senator Bill Heffernan who is opposed to coal seam gas for all of the same reasons the Greens are We have an information gap about CSG in particular and I have Banking is obviously a vital part of everyday life for n households and businesses Every day countless ns rely on the banks for everything from life changing events like buying a house or going into business to things as simple In accordance with standing order 41 c the  will be made an order of the day for the next sitting I move That this House notes the 1 strong investment by the n Government in infrastructure right across Queensland particularly the Mains Road and Kessels Road Intersection Upgrade and the Ipswich Motorway Upgrade 2 commitment by the n Government in Is the motion seconded I second the motion and reserve my right to speak I apologise for my smile as I rise to speak after Senator Waters s outline on the lack of 8212 and I would like Hansard to record this in capital letters and bold please 8212 the OLD PARTIES I am Recently I had the opportunity to launch the Gippsland Tourism Conference which is an important event that provided local tourism industry operators with insights into the industry I told the gathering at that time that I am tired of hearing I value this opportunity to speak about the Bruce Highway It is Queensland s major north south corridor It connects the coastal population centres one of them being your own   Livermore from Brisbane to Cairns over 1 Exactly right Yes It is so bad there 8212 almost exactly on these sites from 14 kilometres north of Gympie to Gympie and then for 24 kilometres south of Gympie 8212 that the speed limit has had to be reduced to 90 Blame the former transport minister It will remain so until the member for Moreton and his colleagues get some serious spending into it because they are way behind in the commitments the coalition made to that section As I said before section B is not The Brisbane Valley Rail Trail is a 161 kilometre recreational trail from Ipswich to Yarraman utilising the old Brisbane Valley rail lines The longest rail trail in the country it provides walkers cyclists and horse riders an opportunity to experience As I go around my electorate the overwhelming message I hear is that small businesses are doing it particularly tough at the moment Across the retail precincts we are now seeing some shops vacant when we have not seen vacancies I rise today to speak about an outstanding business in my electorate I am always pleased to be talking about businesses that are doing exceptionally well and talking them up not talking them down as we often hear on the Last Friday I attended the funeral service of Robert McKechnie or Bob as he was affectionately known in our community Bob was one of the Territory s last surviving Korean War veterans He sadly passed away on 1 September On This federal Labor government has invested a record 8 7 billion in road rail and ports funding in Queensland Those opposite have a trinity of sins when it comes to issues of road funding and infrastructure funding in Queensland For I am pleased to participate in this debate on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Independent Expert Scientific Committee on Coal Seam Gas and Large Coal Mining Development Bill 2012 8212 after my colleague Senator McKenzie from rural Victoria Rural New South Wales Sorry rural New South Wales Senator Heffernan how can I possibly accuse you of being a Queenslander although I know you are a great supporter of things rural and regional and particularly North Queensland and Northern  There we have Back in July this year the  for infrastructure and transport the Leader of the Nationals the shadow parliamentary secretary for roads and regional transport the member for Gippsland and I along with a host of state and federal Correct The member for Herbert will attest to that That was the Vantassel Street and the Flinders Highway intersection It took us raging and screaming from this side of the House and a commitment from the Leader of the Opposition to Good morning colleagues Firstly I congratulate the City Marians Hockey Club on the 75th anniversary of its existence It is a terrific club and a very good night was had by all on Saturday evening As you may well know I rise to talk briefly about a walk which has occurred this morning in Strathalbyn in my electorate Silent Ripples a local group working with local bereavement organisations organised a walk out of the shadows and into the light to I rise today to break the habit of a lifetime and stand in the nation s parliament to say nice things about Alexander Downer more specifically to say nice things about the organisation which Alexander Downer is chairing and which I am really pleased to speak on this particular motion from the member for Moreton not just because he is a good member for his local community but for the fact that he is committed like Labor to really strong Order The member for Oxley has the call It is one thing to come in here and talk about these things but you have to build the roads You wait for us to get into government and when Labor gets into government we take on the hard job Millions of people will be better off under the carbon price That was the claim made by  in her efforts to justify her broken promise to the n people Yet just like her promise to the n I rise to acknowledge a wonderful community resource in my electorate known at the Banksia Gardens Community Services I am sure that every member of this House has at least one neighbourhood house working for and within their local community Order In accordance with standing order 193 the time for constituency statements has concluded I rise to speak on the motion proposed by the member for Moreton When it comes down to it the Rudd Gillard government has spent more than the Howard government but the Howard government actually spent more than the Hawke I support this bill I support it because after much thought I am convinced that it is an argument about justice that all should be equal before the law So in good conscience I can make no other choice I I also rise to talk on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Independent Expert Scientific Committee on Coal Seam Gas and Large Coal Mining Development Bill 2012 This bill could be in danger of becoming a bill that you I think so Righto It is a wooden headed process Thank you But there are a few simple  that this committee has to answer As we all know 8212 but I will say this for those who do not know 8212 coal seam gas has reserves of probably 490 TCF which I move That this bill be now read a second time This is a reform whose time has come because it is clear that in  at the moment there is a mismatch between the hours that people actually work Is the motion seconded I second the motion and reserve my right to speak Thank you  is that be now read a second time I guess here we are again another occasion when the time of the parliament is taken up with this matter of same sex marriage I believe it was going to be five minutes each for 15 speakers and yet there From the outset let me say that I think all people in this place would be in favour of flexible working arrangements that allow people to care for loved ones and for people they have responsibility for But some of I rise to support the Marriage Amendment Bill 2012 which is before the parliament I find the last member s contribution to this debate quite offensive because as a member of a parliament voting on a private member s bill I rise to support the member for Grey for the position he just articulated very strongly on the Fair Work Amendment Better Work Life Balance Bill 2012 The coalition does not support the approach offered by the member for Melbourne Gina has children doesn t she You can talk about Gina Rinehart Member for Moreton and all the hatred that pours out of the Labor Party for people who put their lives on the line to try to build a better and more prosperous  They The member for Mayo said he wanted to challenge two presumptions behind this debate firstly that the government regulates employment relationships better than those involved in the actual workplace itself I think the member for Mayo fails to take into In speaking to this private member s bill the Marriage Amendment Bill 2012 I certainly would like to reconfirm my commitment to removing financial and legal discrimination against same sex couples I have been a very very strong and a We have just heard from the member opposite a litany of examples of how this government is going about re regulating the labour market He says he is proud of it Unfortunately that is a record of which he should Order I thank the member for Higgins for her contribution The time allotted for the debate has expired The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting I thank the member for Lyne for proposing this motion I stand in support of it today As a member of the House Standing Committee on Privileges and Members Interests this motion is of particular interest to me During 2011 Following on from my very good friend the member for Leichhardt let me return the compliment He has been a vigorous persuasive and very effective advocate for the rights of same sex couples and people of a homosexual orientation and We have before us a motion dealing with a code of conduct for members of parliament The member for Lyne wishes that the draft code in the appendices of the  of the House of Representatives Standing Committee of Privileges  is that the motion be agreed to Is the member for Fremantle seeking leave to make a further contribution to the debate I am Mr  Is leave granted Mr  I question why leave should be granted I also note that the member wanted to table an agreement which I am not agreeing to I have heard no good reason why leave should be given to speak My understanding is that there is not ordinarily a debate conducted on  as to whether leave should be granted If a member objects to leave being granted leave is not granted Is the member for Mackellar objecting to leave Yes The member for Mackellar objects so the member for Fremantle will not be heard Are there further contributions to the debate There being no further contributions the debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an I rise to make remarks on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Independent Expert Scientific Committee on Coal Seam Gas and Large Coal Mining Development Bill 2012 In doing so I have to echo some of your comments  The Speaker has received messages from the Senate informing the House that Senator Siewert has been appointed a member of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services I present the  of the n Parliamentary Delegation to the United States of America from 27 September through to 9 October 2011 and ask leave of the House to make a short statement in connection with the  Leave I thank the member for Throsby for bringing this private member s bill to the parliament I note the speech by the member for Wentworth He seems to be longing for a conscience vote Conscience votes are never easy In Honourable Members Honourable members interjecting 8212 He did As my colleague notes Edmund Burke ascribed to great principles but he lasted just two terms in the House of Commons Perhaps that is a lesson for us all This is an issue which a minority in the On behalf of the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs I present the committee s advisory  on the National Integrity Commissioner Bill 2012 together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee In accordance This is a very difficult issue but I rise to speak in favour of the member for Throsby s bill I very much thank him for putting it before the House This is the first conscience vote debate in which On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties I present the committee s  entitled  129 Treaties tabled on 19 and 26 June 2012 In accordance with standing order 39 f the  was made a parliamentary paper I rise today to add my comments to those of my colleagues Senator Nash Senator Williams and Senator McKenzie I think it is also important at this juncture to acknowledge others who although at times I might fight absolutely virulently I wish to pay tribute to and inform the House of the passing of Mr David Ramsay Mr Ramsay was an officer from my department who dedicated the past seven years of his life to strengthening n Indonesian government partnerships I thank the minister As somebody who lived in Indonesia for three years as a child I strongly associate myself with his remarks and acknowledge Mr Brownrigg s presence here in the chamber As the House is aware members of the government have been given a conscience vote on this bill which is appropriate given the significance of the issue and the fact that there are likely to be very strongly held views On behalf of the parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services I present the committee s advisory  on the n Charities and Not for Profits Commission Bill 2012 the n Charities and Not for Profits Commission Consequential and I rise to speak on the Marriage Amendment Bill 2012 and I congratulate the member for Throsby for bringing the matter forward I think it is worthy of debate in this place and the contributions have certainly been worthy I by leave 8212 I am pleased to speak on the  of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services into the n Charities and Not for profits Commission Bill 2012 the n Charities and Not for profits Commission Consequential I rise to speak on the Marriage Amendment Bill 2012 I would like to start by recognising that there are many strong beliefs about the issue of marriage equality Passionate views both in support and in opposition of the changes I refer to some of the comments made by Senator Joyce in terms of his trip to the United States Clearly that is an issue with which policymakers have struggled The issue of compensation to landholders is fundamental It was I rise today to speak on the Aviation  Amendment Liability and Insurance Bill 2012 Despite the government s rhetoric we often hear regarding the opposition s negativity the opposition will continue to hold this government to account We will I rise to support the private member s bill the Marriage Amendment Bill 2012 knowing that it is a matter of great interest to the community  wide and to the community in my electorate Also it affords the opportunity I rise in support of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Independent Expert Scientific Committee on Coal Seam Gas and Large Coal Mining Development Bill 2012 My congratulations to those who crafted such a snappy title The debate we I have always thought that marriage is between a man and a woman That is what I grew up with That is the way it has always been It is what society says it is But society s views are I table a supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the government amendments to be moved to this bill and seek leave to move the two amendments to together Leave granted On behalf of the government I move amendments to I just indicate the opposition s support for those amendments The opposition appreciates the consultation that the government has undertaken and also is cognisant of the need to change the dates around the commencement so that there are no issues It is a pleasure to follow the Minister for Home Affairs and his very thoughtful contribution to this debate I particularly thank the member for Throsby for bringing forward this debate through his private member s bill a very timely I have a number of  for the minister I will then by leave move some of my amendments But firstly I am interested in the fact that this bill sets up a committee under federal laws to effectively advise I rise to support the Aviation  Amendment Liability and Insurance Bill 2012 and the additional protections that it will give to members of the public I start off by saying that despite the constant doom and gloom from the I am advised that there is an agreement between the and state governments entitled the national partnership agreement Within the terms of that agreement state governments are required by 30 September to identify a protocol as to how Can you clarify the enforceability of that agreement I understand that COAG will be undertaking a review of obligations that the parties have taken on under the national partnership agreement and that it would be enforced through COAG arrangements Do I take that to mean that the 50 000 will be withdrawn from states that do not comply with that time frame I think the sum you are referring to is 50 million rather than 50 000 Sums of 50 million have already been paid and others will be paid subject to the deliberations of COAG and the review of the obligations Forgive me I found your last response a little hard to follow The 50 million will be reviewed if the states do not meet that 30 September time frame meaning that money will be subject to be brought back by As I understand it some of the 50 million has been paid and the remainder will be paid subject to COAG s review of obligations found under the national partnership agreement So of the money that has already been paid what mechanism is in place to ensure that those legislative amendments at the state level are made in compliance with that agreement given that the money has already been paid Not all of the 50 million has been paid so first let me clarify that Second there is an obligation on states to make legislative changes by the 30 September deadline The protocol is that the legislative changes would need Thank you I am pleased to hear that there is perhaps some wriggle room in the nature of those amendments The national partnership agreement terminology is that the states need to amend their laws in order to take account of Unfortunately I do not have any advice for the Senate on the meaning of that terminology Parliamentary Secretary can you advise why that requirement to take account of is not reflected in before this place There has been a decision made about what is found in the  and what is found in the agreement and it is the view of government that those arrangements are sufficient to meet the intent of and Thank you So clearly the intent of government is to set up a committee which has no teeth which can provide advice if requested by the federal minister 8212 which he then cannot act on because he has no water Let me say from the outset that I have attended same sex weddings They happen in  often For those who have not attended one I would say that there are many things you would find familiar There are vows I do not think that was really  was it Obviously that is your view or perspective on the proposition that is before the Senate It is not the view of government Thank you I certainly would have preferred to see a much stronger bill than the one before us If the view of government and the intention of government were in fact different then perhaps they ought to have reflected that I am getting some advice for you on that Senator but I understand that it is broader than you have described it and that the minister has other triggers to act as well But perhaps I will take that on Flying is possibly the safest mode of transport yet developed though we have records of aviation crashes and it is critical that we create a framework which meets the needs of modern aviation If I can take the House through With respect it is a fundamental question I would expect that the drafters of are fully aware of the existing triggers in our environmental laws as I am Water is not one of them and the whole basis Looking at the relevant provision 131AB 1 b parts i and ii 8212 I remember that I will now read it for the benefit of the senate you will be thrilled to know Senator Heffernan b the Minister believes that the taking of the action i is likely to have a significant impact on water resources With respect I would ask you to check with your advisers on that point The whole purpose of having an adverse impact on a matter protected by part 3 is that part 3 only protects those matters from significant impact I think it is also worth noting that sitting alongside this are the state referrals that go through the protocol which means that state ministers or for that matter territory ministers can also take account with regard to state matters I rise to speak on the Marriage Amendment Bill 2012 and I would like to take the opportunity of thanking the member for Throsby for putting forward this bill and therefore allowing this debate There are some people and some That did not really answer my question but I think it does serve to illustrate that my understanding is correct This bill sets up a committee to primarily advise the states who only need to take account of the advice I do not have an answer to that question Senator The  is before you I obviously take account of and note your critique of that  but I am not in a position to comment about what future governments Clearly this is evidence 8212 and I have studied this for a long time 8212 of what I said earlier in the day that this  would be good if it got the right set of teeth but as it Minister I now want to move to  of salt It was raised by a number of speakers in the  debate on this bill 8212 that is the sheer vast amount of salt that will be produced That will be a matter for the committee Obviously this committee has been established to explore and ensure that there is better understanding of the various challenges that exist in this space I suspect with respect to salt and fugitive I am pleased to hear that but unfortunately I am perplexed because that is not reflected in the wording of Can you take me to the section where the committee is empowered to consider the impacts on our The committee is not constrained from looking at the matters you have described and on a reference from the minister would be one of many ways in which the committee could do the kind of work you are describing I rise to speak in support of the Aviation  Amendment Liability and Insurance Bill 2012 This bill essentially gives expression to actions agreed to arising out of the 2009 national aviation policy white paper That paper from memory was With respect Minister I think the committee is constrained by the functions set out in clause 505D which all come back to the impacts of coal and coal seam gas on water resources rather than on the climate on the If those issues being salt and fugitive emissions have an impact on water then that would trigger the jurisdiction of the  Minister that was my earlier point The salt will have an impact on the land because there is no known safe storage We are talking about 700 000 tonnes of salt per year for which there is not an approved storage It is the most toxic Minister I was pleased to hear you express earlier that you thought that salt and climate should be within the remit of this committee and I would be very eager for you to raise that with your colleagues and amend I am advised that while states do have responsibility for these matters this  has at its very heart the notion that better scientific analysis and better transparency will be achieved through the agency of Commonwealth  The  deals with most serious problem we have got besides the contamination of the aquifers which we do not understand CSIRO does not understand it no one understands the interconnectivity at the low geological point fault lines with the I am advised that we can only look at the issue of salt insofar as it impacts on 8212 Water Right With great respect that absolutely makes the point This is completely and fundamentally flawed  Salt is the most toxic substance tied to agriculture and yet this  as the minister points out is silent on salt I p Minister Senator Heffernan I will take your point as debate The government notes and thanks you for the fact that you will be supporting this  Minister I want to take you back to your answer to my previous question when I asked what the government thought was the role of the in this sphere in regulating coal seam gas and you said you It is not government policy that investment in this particular industry and these various technologies be ceased by a moratorium To use your own word what transparency are you seeking then Can you please explain your previous comment What I am saying is that while this  will in the government s view strengthen the process going forward it does not bring about a moratorium on current investment The industry does not cease to exist until this committee I am aware of that How on earth are you attempting to strengthen the process if approvals can be issued before the advice of this committee is even given I am just struggling to understand the logic there There is nothing I can add to the answer by leave 8212 I move n Greens amendments 1 and 2 on sheet 7233 together 1 160 160 160 Schedule 1 item 4 page 4 line 29 omit other than the Chair 2 160 160 160 Schedule 1 item 4 This amendment is not supported The intent of the committee is adequately met through the provisions of including the amendment moved by Mr Macfarlane and agreed by the House of Representatives Relevant expertise will be sufficiently represented It Minister is there an intention to include public health experts if they are as you say not precluded It is at the discretion of the minister I am happy to pass on your query to him and see if there is any further information he would like to provide Thank you Minister Perhaps you could pass on to the minister our strong urgings for him to include public health experts on that committee Minister could I get a comment on how these appointments are actually to be made At this stage no decisions have been made I am happy to take that on board and see if Minister Burke would like to outline the process Minister I am sure you would have listened to my  debate contribution to this bill Senator Conroy interjecting 8212 I am sure you would have been listening Minister I was just making the point that I hope you The Aviation  Amendment Liability and Insurance Bill 2012 which I also support will modernise  s arrangements for our air carriers liability under the Civil Aviation Carriers Liability Act 1959 and the Damage by Aircraft Act 1999 It implements I am not sure we will be able to provide you with all of that information the you sought in the chamber in the time left for debate but I am happy to see what information can be made available Minister the time left for the debate could be five minutes or it could be five hours As far as I know the Greens have not agreed to guillotine this bill through the chamber so I suspect the debate will The old  s Christmas card list has been the style in which your previous government made major appointments but I can assure you we do go to greater lengths than checking Mr Howard s Christmas card list before Thank you Minister I had hoped that you might be able to do that before we actually have to vote on There must be a process surely This is the chamber this is the time this is the I do have a little bit of extra information for you I understand that there will be some consultations between the minister and his state counterparts but as to the interaction I have no confidence in the commission following the Chair he should withdraw 8212 What boofhead It is a reflection on the Senate Senator Heffernan would take that as a term of endearment wouldn t you Senator Heffernan in the normal run of the mill course of events Order Minister Would you please direct your remarks through the chair I will happily do that Senator Heffernan might be shocked but I will withdraw it Is that the completion of your answer The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN No Are you standing on a point of order Senator Heffernan No I want to make a point The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN No I am not sure that following the savage cuts to staffing that are taking place in Queensland 8212 all of those good Queensland public servants that are losing their jobs because of the Campbell Newman government 8212 are going to  Temporary Chairman I rise on a point of order 8212 If it is a point of order Bill cool but you do not get to comment until I am finished I would hope that commission gets its opportunity following the savage cuts that are coming from that Liberal National Party I enter into this debate to try to get some serious answers The  speech people spoke far and wide across a range of issues but in the committee stage I am trying to get some answers If Senator It s a pretty broad front line in Queensland Wait and see You were the one who wanted to have a bet with me on who would win the Queensland election At least most of your colleagues would only bet on how big the margin would be I think Senator Heffernan is behind you and he wants to speak next Well he will too and he has a very sensible question But can I repeat mine There are now three  that I would like answered can you tell me the broad parameters of how your commission is going to I rise to speak to the Aviation  Amendment Liability and Insurance Bill 2012 Like the member for Corangamite I have a general aviation airport in my electorate the Archerfield Airport Also with Moreton being very close to the start I think that you have actually repeated at least two of those for the third time And I can understand why you are actually embarrassed about what is going on in Queensland You may be happy to be sacking public Order Minister please address your remarks through the chair My apologies  Temporary Chair Senator Macdonald may be happy that thousands and thousands of Queenslanders are losing their jobs As to 8212  Temporary Chair I rise on point of order I am disgusted the point of order being that this is a 8212 The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN Order There is  of order Minister you have the call All we have As I said Senator Macdonald I will see if there is any further information 8212 I have said this now three times 8212 that I can obtain for you while this debate is going on Minister you are fresh in the chamber on this bill could you just confirm to me that this bill which is designed to do research on the coal seam gas industry excludes in its ambit investigating the problem of salt I am sure that he enjoyed your personal visit I am advised that the  is to provide scientific advice to the environment minister in relation to proposed coal seam gas developments or large coal mining developments that are likely Thank you very much that is an excellent answer What it does is point out the complete flaw in and the urgent need

Republic of Nauru as a regional processing country under section 198AB 1 of the Migration Act We are debating the substantive motion as I understand it with the amendment included Thank you I think it is an extremely sad day today to be standing here and seeing both the Labor Party and the coalition lining up shoulder to shoulder as Senator Cash has already outlined to approve the dumping of Mr Acting  I would like clarification Now that Senator Cash has moved her amendment are we debating the amendment or the substantive motion That is why people were sewing their lips together Senator Hanson Young asserts that the government has adopted Mr Tony Abbott s policy in relation to asylum seekers If only that were true because although the government has adopted one element of the coalition s policy 8212 that is It was the Howard government that lifted to the highest level that any n government ever did our humanitarian intake and yet that is mocked by the Greens in their posturing moral vanity Senator Hanson Young asserts that the loss What are you doing about it What about the children I hear Senator Hanson Young ask Yes Senator Hanson Young what about the children who would be alive today if the Howard government s policy of putting the people smugglers out of business had not been What about the children who 8212 I will tell you what we are doing about it Senator Hanson Young What we did about it in 2001 was deprive the people smugglers of a product to sell so they could not entrap or induce these gullible and I rise today to oppose the government s move to send to Nauru refugees who are seeking asylum in our country It is inconsistent with the refugee convention and with our responsibilities as a nation to people who are refugees Earlier this year I had the privilege of participating in the n National Internships Program and was assigned a student from ANU I have previously participated in the program which provides the opportunity for a student to work in Parliament It has been an exciting time in my electorate of Kingston over the last few weeks I have attended the openings of a number of important local s that will improve the southern Adelaide region significantly It is important to Is there any objection to leave being granted Leave granted My question is to the Minister representing  Senator Evans Given  marked 10 000 people having arrived on illegal boats this year alone in  does the minister stand by the statement he made on Q amp Order on  Opposition Senators Opposition senators interjecting 8212 My question is to the  I refer him to the guidelines on the treatment of persons rescued at sea published by the International Maritime Organisation that state The government responsible for the Search and Rescue region in I see that while the House of Representatives have followed Mr Turnbull s advice the opposition in the Senate have decided to ignore it and continue with their negative use of  Can I say also that I got I inform the House that the Minister for Climate Change Energy Efficiency Industry and Innovation will be absent from  today for personal reasons The Minister for Infrastructure and Transport will answer  in relation to climate change and   I rise on a point of order It was a very straightforward question about why the government will not return asylum seekers found in Indonesian waters to Indonesia as is required and the Treasurer should answer the This government will never 8212 I repeat never 8212 seek to direct the Navy when it comes to operations at sea There is a stark contrast between our approach and the approach of those over there It has been nine The Manager of Opposition Business will  his seat It was a very long question with many things raised in it but I do ask the  to return to  before the chair I thank the Leader of the Opposition for that question I am certain that the member for Wentworth does not thank him I will deal with  in detail First of all these are matters which are decided for Mr President I ask a  Given that following the government s announcement to reopen Nauru almost 2 000 people have continued to arrive on illegal boats will the minister now concede that the government need to go beyond Following the failure of the government to get cooperation from the opposition on some of our proposed responses we sought to implement in full the Houston  That  was provided to the government and we sought to get parliamentary The highly narky political  by  does her no credit It does not advance public debate in this country at all The opposition fail to take public debate seriously They fail to make a contribution One of The  has concluded his answer   I rise on a point of order The Treasurer is clearly being offensive and I would ask you to direct him to use parliamentary language in answering  Isn t it interesting 8212 the Leader of the Opposition stands up and advocates a breach of the refugee convention which was precisely the ground on which he opposed our proposal for processing in Malaysia No fact demonstrates more that Mr President I ask a further  I refer to  s statement when  for immigration Another boat arrival another policy failure Given that one of the many reasons for the political execution of former   I ask a  Given that today we saw the 10 000th illegal arrival by boat just in this year will the government now reintroduce temporary protection visas and turn back the boats where it is My question is to the Minister for Agriculture Fisheries and Forestry Senator Ludwig Can the minister please inform the Senate on the government s role in maintaining long term sustainable fish stocks in  and the role of the n Will the  outline the importance of keeping our economy strong while making sure we support those most in need I thank the member for Blair for that question Our economy still walks tall in the world and we are continuing to grow faster than every single major advanced economy This is a remarkable achievement given the backdrop of what I thank Senator Thorp for her question The Gillard government has today announced it will introduce  to strengthen the environmental controls on vessels like the Abel Tasman The new  will also allow the government to establish an expert   I ask a  I refer to the  s answer in which he talked about helping those most in need while building the economy What would be the impact for those most in I inform the House that we have present in the gallery today His Excellency Mr Marcel Stutz from the Swiss embassy On behalf of the House I extend him a very warm welcome Honourable members Hear hear Maybe we could The only thing worse than a Liberal cutting jobs is three Liberals cutting jobs That is what those opposite stand for Order The member for Goldstein is not assisting and he should also mind his language on occasion I withdraw Mr Robb interjecting 8212 I thank Senator Thorp for her first  Labor governments have always been strong defenders and managers of n fisheries you need only look at the record to know that is true Our world class fisheries management system was Mr President I ask a  Can the minister please inform the Senate how Labor has strengthened our fisheries resulting in some of the best managed fisheries in the world and how this will support the fishing industry in Order The  will withdraw the comment I thank the member for Blair for that question We are hearing some very disturbing s about cuts to education in New South Wales We are hearing that these are the biggest cuts in 20 years As I said before I thank Senator Thorp for her second  The Liberals and Nationals should support the review and the government s amendments Senator Colbeck himself said just three weeks ago that he acknowledged that the science continues to evolve and Mr President I ask a further  Can the minister please share some of the recent concerns of members of parliament regarding n fisheries and tell us how the government amendments will alleviate such concerns My question is to the  I refer the Treasurer to  s statement less than a month ago that business can have a company tax rate cut before Christmas How can the government fund its This is a breathtaking question from the shadow Treasurer because first of all he and the Liberals actually stand for a company tax increase That is the Coles and Woolies grocery tax they still have on their agenda Second when Honourable Senators Honourable senators interjecting 8212 Order When there is silence we will proceed My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer Senator Wong I refer to the 900 job losses in  s second largest export sector announced by  s two largest coal producers  Can the minister confirm that consistent I have listened to your point of order and there is  of order There is a new point of order Order 8212 Senator Cameron I am waiting for order Mr President 8212 Even Barnaby is objecting The minister has effectively suggested that  in relation to the economic impact of the carbon tax and the impact of the carbon tax on international competitiveness and on jobs in  are not appropriately directed to the Treasury portfolio As such the minister should be required to answer all of  instead of unilaterally ruling part of  out of order without even asking you to make a ruling Order On my right 8212 I need order No I am raising a point of order This is a very important point of order because the minister 8212 Government senators interjecting 8212 Order This is now debating the issue Senator Cormann Mr President the minister has invited you effectively to rule out part of my question as being inappropriately directed to her as representing the Treasurer The economic impact of the carbon tax 8212 Order On  Mr President I rise on a point of order The minister has just queried whether  was appropriately directed to her as minister representing the Treasurer The economic point of order 8212 Honourable senators interjecting 8212 Only part of that was  properly directed to the Treasurer In relation to  about carbon I would remind  that Senator Ludwig 8212 Mr President I rise on a point of order What  8212 Honourable senators interjecting 8212 Wait a minute Senator Ludwig Order Order No Senator Joyce I have Senator Cormann on his feet for a point of order In terms of what has occurred in the economy since carbon pricing has been announced we see in the year to June that private investment has grown now to be at its highest percentage of GDP in 40 years The I believe that the minister is answering  The minister does have 46 seconds remaining to answer  Mr President I rise on a point of order My point of order is that the minister is not being directly relevant to   was directed to the effect of the carbon tax assumptions in the budget Just do what you re told same as what Tony told you Thank you Mr President That in fact is what I was going on to say that I am happy to take those aspects of  which are properly directed to the Treasurer s portfolio However I would have thought I have ruled on the issue already There was  of order The minister can answer that part of  that relates to the portfolio That has always been the way in which this chamber has operated This is a new point of order This issue was not raised by Senator Wong In truth  that was asked should have been directed at the representative me handling climate change and not to the Treasurer It was   I ask a  Will the Treasurer rule out tax increases to pay for his 120 billion black hole Order Dr Emerson interjecting 8212 The minister for trade is not assisting the operations of the parliament The  in his capacity as Treasurer has the call Government Members Government members interjecting 8212 I answered this question in full  I said our commitment is to keep the tax to GDP ratio below the level that we inherited That is what I said  Once again there is such a clear contrast between   on a point of order I ask the Treasurer not to play games Will he rule out tax increases We on this side of the House understand the importance of putting in place a range of policies which secure economic growth and allow governments to provide opportunities for all of their people Of course those on that side of The member for North Sydney will  his seat Honourable members interjecting 8212 Given the level of noise on all sides of the chamber it would be virtually impossible to have heard what the  said before The The  will return to  before the chair We on this side of the House are absolutely committed to economic growth and providing the basic services for all our people My question is to the Minister for Sustainability Environment Water Population and Communities Will the minister update the House on the latest information concerning the super trawler recently renamed the FV Abel Tasman How will the government act to protect I hear people opposite calling out risk but you will never hear them call out environmental risk You will never hear them care for a moment about that And I do not know what their problem is with the oceans Opposition Members Opposition members interjecting 8212 This government is very proud of its record in protecting our oceans This government is very proud that we take a cautious approach to the management of our oceans I want to acknowledge the member for Fremantle as one of Mr President I ask a  When Treasury assessed the economic and fiscal impact of the carbon tax did they consider that the European emissions trading scheme does not apply to the fugitive emissions from coalmining Did Treasury consider Before I call the member a loyal South n I recognise in the gallery today many members from the South n Local Government Association and with them many mayors and councillors I believe they have been here meeting with many Order I do draw the minister s attention to  The minister has 41 seconds remaining In terms of what Treasury did and did not take into account as  would know we have published the Treasury modelling and the assumptions contained within that It contains a great deal of information including the assumptions about Order Mr President I rise on a point of order As you have ruled before on several occasions it is not proper for ministers to comment on s  that Senator Cormann asked had three parts and each was I do not know why it is such a problem to ask Senator Ludwig  He is very good at answering them You always tell me how bad I am at answering them and now quite clearly Senator Ludwig could Because this is on the economic impact of the carbon tax 8212 If you would let me finish Senator Cormann These are  which are more properly addressed to Senator Ludwig 8212 Again many aspects of that question asked about international pricing of carbon which 8212 I specifically asked if Treasury considered 8212 My question is to the  If the Treasurer is serious about finding savings to fund his 120 billion black hole by cutting back on waste why has the carbon tax regulator just spent 20 000 on eight Senator Wong you are entitled to be heard in silence Order Senator Wong continue The government thinks it is very important to put in place a market price on carbon to get a reduction in carbon pollution at the least possible cost to our economy We are committed to that and there are many This is an opposition which is constantly at war with the facts which is why we constantly get all these aggressive  with all of the exaggeration We constantly get this from them because there is no real alternative policy Order The  has the call and will be heard in silence I was asked about implementation of a clean energy package and about the emissions trading scheme I was asked about expenditure in our relevant authorities Opposition members interjecting 8212 The Leader of the House will  his seat For the edification of the House the previous one was ruled out of order so I am going to give the Manager of Opposition Business the ability to be relevant 8212 The Manager of Opposition Business will  his seat   I rise on a point of order This could not possibly be relevant to  that was asked It was a very specific question about waste and the  should be required to answer There is an inconsistency in the approach of the opposition when it comes to emissions trading which they supported for many years There is a very interesting revelation today in the n Financial Review from Christopher Joye He said In I withdraw The member for Mayo will leave the chamber under standing order 94A and the member for Mayo can withdraw before he leaves The opposition have already had one 8212 An opposition member Oh boo hoo Thank you Mr President The thoughts of people on this side of the chamber are with the workers and families who are affected by those decisions Unlike those opposite we would not seek to make political mileage of it Unlike   I rise on a point of order The Treasurer should have a look in his brown paper bag to see whether he has an answer The reality is that we have seen some announcements in the mining sector in relation to job cuts and the thoughts of those on this side of the chamber are with the workers and families affected by 8212 Honourable senators If Senator Cormann wants to talk about destroying jobs I suggest he go to Queensland and talk to Premier Newman and the thousands of public servants he said he would not sack and is now proposing to sack He wants Mr President I rise on a point of order You heard  You should rule that comments on what may or may not be happening in the Queensland Public Service bear no relevance whatsoever directly or indirectly to a Order The minister has been going 13 seconds I do draw the minister s attention to  You have 47 seconds remaining Mr President on the point of order once again I need to raise the habit that Senator Brandis seems to be continuing again today He reframes  He narrows it to the one thing that has stuck in his The Queensland Public Service you goose It seems Senator Brandis will not even allow someone to conclude their comments on a point of order Senator Wong is referring to the Treasury modelling and indeed the impact on the economy and jobs She has done that in Mr President I ask a further  In this context I refer the minister to her response to my question  when she said she stands by the Treasury modelling of the carbon tax Does that mean the minister My question is to Senator Evans representing the Minister for Families Community Services and Indigenous Affairs The Minister for Families Community Services and Indigenous Affairs has just confirmed that the single rate of the pension which is indexed in line My question is to the   you would be aware that the Tasmanian government plans to legislate for marriage equality and has already passed the state lower house What are the I thank Senator Siewert for  I first acknowledge the young people from the Learn Earn Legend program the Indigenous work experience program who are in the gallery Unfortunately we are trying to put on a bit of a We stick by our policies The Labor Party recognises that this is an issue on which members of our caucus have deeply held personal beliefs and it is therefore appropriate for our members to vote on same sex marriage according to their conscience That s not what you said before The member for Cowan is warned The  had d his seat when the member for Denison sought  If he is seeking a supplementary I will advise that there is only one allowed for Independents during a sitting week That was my So much for the once great 8212 Yes but not your conscience Order The member for Menzies The  has the call The Minister for Families Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Minister for Disability Reform I thank the member for Denison for his question I am aware of to provide for same sex marriage and it will shortly I think be considered by the Tasmanian Legislative Council This is a matter which is   I rise on a point of order as to relevance I think the Tasmanian community would be very grateful to know simply the answer to  does the intend to overturn it if it I acknowledge  s interest and knowledge in this area but my advice is that around 60 per cent of Newstart recipients stay on payment for less than 12 months But I am happy to be corrected if that Mr President I ask a  I am presuming that the minister is aware that over 60 per cent of people on Newstart are on it for over 12 months Is the minister confident that 145 a week will My question is to the Minister for School Education Early Childhood and Youth Will the minister outline why we need to invest in a national plan to improve all of our schools The member for Dickson may stuff up his chance to be in the House for much longer Mr President I ask a further  There has been some confusion in the media over the last couple of days about the different levels of allowances between those living on Newstart and those who are on the minimum I do not intend to offer a running commentary on the deliberations of the Tasmanian parliament Mr Dutton interjecting 8212   I ask a  Does the 8212 a simple yes or no would be fine please 8212 intend to try to overturn any successful Tasmanian move to legislate for same sex marriage I thank the member for Parramatta for her question For students to reach their full capacity and for the nation to have sustainable prosperity investing in education is absolutely crucial I think I heard President Obama say that education is I will have to take that part of  on notice I saw some debate about the differences with the minimum wage but I do not have a brief on that so I do not want to mislead the My question is to Senator Ludwig the Minister representing the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency As a result of Labor s decision to link its carbon tax to the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme n coal producers will I thank Senator Joyce One of the difficulties in this is always the opposition s continued opposition to it That is how they seem to be yelling about it But the premise of  8212 or perhaps the way Mr President I rise on a point of order on relevance The substance of  is quite clear why does Europe get a subsidy for their coal producers and we have to pay a tax What is the explanation There is  of order I believe the minister is answering  The minister does have 31 seconds remaining And of course it is one of those areas where 8212 perhaps Senator Joyce did not hear when I first answered him 8212 they have a different scheme They regulate whereas what we are doing is using the market based The Minister for School Education Early Childhood and Youth has the call and will be heard in silence the member for Cook   I ask a  Minister what would be the impact of cutting funding to schools and education systems particularly for my home state of New South Wales Mr Morrison interjecting 8212 I thank the member for Parramatta for that question Incidentally in the member s electorate she has some 43 buildings 8212 100 million of investment in new education infrastructure She has some 9 700 computers in place She has eight Mr President I ask a  Given that n businesses collectively already have to pay five times as much carbon tax over the next three years as all the businesses across 30 European countries does the government now recognise   on a point of order the Treasurer is now not being relevant He was simply asked if he would rule out extra taxes on diesel fuel in order to fund his 120 billion black hole He is I had not finished Most importantly one of the areas for small business is the materiality of that increase to the business what portion of that increase to their revenue is generated by the business Time expired That is not a point of order Mr President I rise on a point of order This is  about businesses and we are getting an answer about households He might have been handed the wrong piece of paper 8212 so if the lady would like I can continue to say that what we do have is a system where on average the n carbon price will cost households 9 90 per week with average compensation of 10 10 per week These are the official figures I was asked  about so called holes in budgets I have also said that in going through and having all of our deliberations about what we will put in various mid year statements and budgets we will do The  will return to  before the chair My question is to the  I refer to Labor s claim that it would bring the budget back to surplus this financial year despite collecting much less revenue than forecast and needing to fund its 120 billion I thank the shadow finance minister for his question I think I answered this question  and I have answered it already today The fact is that we are determined to bring our budget back to surplus We have put The Manager of Opposition Business will  his seat The  has the call I do not accept the very premise of  The only hole around here is the 70 billion hole in their budget bottom line which the shadow Treasurer admitted to on breakfast television right beside the minister for the Mr President I ask a further  Given government revelations last night that not one single free carbon permit has been issued by the Gillard government to an n business and at most only 170 of the 42 500 Order on my right Order on my left When there is silence we will proceed Perhaps to help Senator Joyce so that he does not make the same mistake on foreign investment the government s auction policy is not about the budget bottom line or maximising revenue it is there to transition to an emissions An extraordinary question again from Senator Joyce Senator Joyce interjecting 8212 You should stick to foreign investment Yes perhaps foreign investment My question is to the Minister for Health Will the minister inform the House how the government is investing in health for all ns How is the government working with states and territories to deliver front line health services for My question is to the Minister for Broadband Communications and the Digital Economy Senator Conroy Can the minister advise the Senate why the government is building the National Broadband Network to deliver at least 100 megabits per second on the I thank the member for Moreton for that really important question We know that the cuts that we are seeing in the Queensland health budget are just the curtain raiser on the cuts that this Leader of the Opposition would There s a lot of fat We have a list here of the s of the cuts 8212 nurses pathology cancer screening allied health physios occupational therapy prevention services flu vaccine whooping cough vaccine The list is a long one This is just a precursor to I thank  for his question The Gillard government is committed to building the NBN to meet  s current and future broadband needs Those opposite have no similar commitment The member for Wentworth continually denies there is a My question is to the  I refer the  to the government s claim that it will bring the budget back to surplus this financial year despite collecting less revenue than forecast and its growing I said before that I certainly do not agree with the figure that was put forward by the member It was simply shoddy journalism that appeared in the n Financial Review and had no basis in truth As for the Mr President I ask a  Can the minister provide other examples of telecommunications executives explaining the benefit of fibre to the home over other technologies including hybrid fibre coax I told the Senate  of the plans of Telefonica to provide fibre to the home to 1 3 million premises in Madrid In making the announcement this is what the Telefonica executives had to say Compared to other solutions 8212 The member for Wentworth despite his own personal investment habits continues to insist that  does not need fibre to the home He claims we can make do with fibre to the node for the rest and extend to Mr President I ask a further  Can fibre to the node provide a cost effective pathway to fibre to the home I thank the member for Petrie very much for that question and for all the work she does for very vulnerable people in her electorate of Petrie Of course this government gets on with helping people who are vulnerable in My question is to the Minister for Families Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Minister for Disability Reform Will the minister outline to the House how the government is supporting vulnerable people including people with disability in my home state Mr President my question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer Senator Wong I refer the minister to the recent Global competitiveness  2012 2013 by the World Economic Forum Given the World Economic Forum ranked  15th in the Honourable Senators Honourable senators interjecting 8212 If  cares about the attractiveness of  as an investment destination he should first recognise that there is more investment occurring in this country than we have seen for decades previously It certainly is a share of the  seems to assume or to make a clear implication that people do not want to invest in this country And if that is the case why is it we have seen private investment at the highest level as Mr President I rise on a point of order going to relevance  was about competitiveness  asked one thing why has  slipped from 15th to 20th on the competitiveness table It was not about investment You I believe the minister is answering  The minister has 48 seconds remaining According to Senator Brandis economics investment and competiveness are completely different they are never linked and there is nothing associated with competitiveness when people look at investment That is clearly the position of the coalition And I can understand why Here we go with more of the exaggerations more of the inaccurate statements 8212 everything the member for Wentworth was talking about 8212 and these inaccurate characterisations of the impact of a carbon price The Commonwealth Treasury and the Department The Manager of Opposition Business will  his seat The  has the call Unlike those on that side of the House I have a deep commitment to our hospitals and understand the importance of them If you are going to sack 3 000 Queensland health employees 8212 as the health minister said before On a point of order   the  was asked about the effect of the carbon tax on hospitals 8212 nothing else He should not be talking about Campbell Newman They knocked off 30 beds the other day and there is more to come We have just had Campbell Newman announce job cuts of 14 000 The member for Dickson is warned My question is to the  I refer the  to my visit to Bendigo Hospital last week and to the assessment it commissioned which shows that the hospital will be hit by up to 600 My question is to the  I refer the  to the statement of the Mayor of the City of Onkaparinga Lorraine Rosenberg 8212 who is in the gallery today 8212 that the carbon tax will Mr President I ask a  I refer to those World Economic Forum rankings The economic rankings across 144 countries also measure the extent to which taxation impacts on the incentives to work and invest Does the government believe Is the member for Boothby seeking to table a  He was asking me about the impact of a carbon price and I think I am entitled to point out that he has been a supporter of a carbon price Now he is opposing a carbon price and exaggerating a The member for Mackellar will  her seat The answer to  is to the entire question and  asked about the price on carbon The  has the call On a point of order   in order to be relevant even under the old rules there had to be a link to the substance of  To try to do a character assassination of the person Today I have already referred to the exaggeration and misrepresentation that we have seen from those opposite including the member for Boothby He came into this House a week or so ago and made a whole set of representations and Order It is true that you have to have an eye to the effect of taxation on work and on investment That is one of the reasons why this government is implementing an increase in the tax free threshold which will Opposition Senators Opposition senators interjecting 8212 Thank you In relation to carbon pricing and mining investment I would make the point that we have seen private investment including in the resources sector increase since those two policies were announced I also would make this point but My question is to the Minister for Employment Workplace Relations Financial Services and Superannuation What is the government doing to make sure ns have good jobs and a strong economy Why is it important for the government to support jobs The member for Boothby will  his seat The Minister for Defence I seek leave to table the article in Southern Times Messenger which provides more detail on the 800 000 8212 Mr President I ask a further  In the same global competitiveness   has plunged from 66th in the world on the burden of government regulation criterion to 96th in the world Can the minister explain how the Leave is not granted I thank the member for his question The Labor Party is the political party for working ns We stand for jobs We stand for good jobs we stand for skilled jobs and we stand for fair jobs Our record shows I assume that  is not suggesting that we should take Botswana as the benchmark when it comes to labour rights or employment conditions or wage rates I assume he is not taking the position that Ms Rinehart has Thank you Mr President Given that Paris Aristotle has said that the government needs to increase its humanitarian intake with direct resettlement from Indonesia Malaysia and Pakistan is the government misleading the n public when it claims that offshore processing My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship Senator Lundy Minister noting that the numbers of people waiting for deportation to Nauru now exceed the numbers and capacity on Nauru and that Houston panel member Honourable Senators Honourable senators interjecting 8212 Order Just wait a minute Senator Hanson Young Order on  Senator Hanson Young is entitled to be heard in silence Please continue Senator Hanson Young My question is to the  I refer to the failed 2 billion Contract for Closure scheme to close brown coal power stations and to the 5 189 billion Energy Security Fund to keep open brown coal power The  is another one who has changed his position Having written his thesis on a market price for carbon he now comes in and says we should have one because we did not proceed with one or two Once again we have this incredible hypocrisy from those opposite Mr Tony Smith interjecting 8212   a point of order on relevance  was is it the policy to open or close brown coal power stations Mr Robb interjecting 8212 The member for Goldstein is going to be tossed very quickly if he is not careful The member for Casey is warned The government is determined to implement the expert panel s recommendations to stop the flow of boats and prevent the loss of life on dangerous boat journeys There will be no advantage for people risking their lives on people smuggling These are the people who went out and said that carbon pricing would mean death for the Latrobe Valley 8212 an incredibly irresponsible statement which shows just how far they will go and how desperate they will be to spread My question is to the Minister for Housing Minister for Homelessness and Minister for Small Business What has the government done to help vulnerable people access housing and to reduce homelessness in  How has the government partnered with states Mr President I ask a  Minister when indeed is the government going to implement the increase to the humanitarian intake When is the first group of refugees from Indonesia Malaysia and Pakistan expected to arrive in  Senator Hanson Young I am happy to refer the detail of that to the minister The issue is that we have announced the increase of 20 000 people in our humanitarian intake Our increased refugee intake and the 10 million Mr President I ask a further  It seems that the minister was unable to answer that question and I hope that it will be taken on notice Minister how long will women and children be detained in tents I thank the member for Capricornia for her question and for her ongoing interest in this very important area of social policy The government knows that there are too many ns who are homeless there are too many people sleeping Order Wait a minute Senator Order on my left Senator Cameron interjecting 8212 Senator Cameron I am trying to get order so that I can hear Senator Lundy s answer Senator Lundy continue Honourable Senators Honourable senators interjecting 8212 Again as Senator Hanson Young well knows it is envisaged that for some period hopefully not too long 8212 Senator Hanson Young I think understands well that the minister has made a statement about the use of temporary accommodation on Nauru and that this will make it possible for transfers to occur 8212 hopefully the first transfers to occur I move That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Tertiary Education Skills Science and Research Senator Evans to  without notice asked by Senator Cash today relating to border protection and asylum seekers I thank the member for his question I think they are very sensitive because what we have put in place is a level of service that provides the front line services that are required in this country I seem to My question is to the  I refer to his statements earlier about Public Service jobs Can the Treasurer confirm that in his own budget papers he states that he is axing over 3 000 jobs in the This is further to an answer to  Senator McKenzie asked me in my capacity representing Mr Ferguson regarding power station closures It was  on 21 June Minister Ferguson has provided more information supplementary to the answer I seek leave to table page 1 of the Canberra Times no public service cuts Gillard pledges 8212 and the budget paper cutting 3 000 jobs here You hypocrite I withdraw If seeking to table s and making points of order continue to be abused we will see very few people in this chamber It is an absolute abuse Is leave granted We have the budget papers so no Leave not granted The member for North Sydney will withdraw My question is to the Minister for Employment Participation and Minister for Early Childhood and Childcare

knots Labor is in a complete mess over the carbon tax the government is in complete chaos over the carbon tax Why is Let me say that we have not really had the debate because there are philosophical positions that people bring into this chamber based on personal biases and viewpoints In the electorate when I doorknock I find that people express very I want to acknowledge the comments of the member for Hindmarsh I have worked with him on a committee and I have always found him to be a fair man but sometimes we can make mistakes in the way that Order The discussion is now concluded We ve

said even people on his own side of politics But it does Please proceed Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented Moments ago the environment minister posted a tweet He obviously

move That this bill be now read a second time Over recent weeks and months there has been heightened community concern surrounding the potential introduction of a new style of large scale fishing

bumbling process that one would ever see It is an approach that General Port Lincoln That is where it is thank you very much And why did they change it Because it was popular All I am waiting for is the apology because otherwise you are total and utter hypocrites It is all It s in Port Lincoln No it is not a surprise And of course there is always a  card coming out and it is called the debt Every

of the Paralympic movement since the first Stoke Mandeville Games more than six decades ago I Another day another fear campaign another bungled distorted rant by Senator Joyce Fear spin and distortion of the facts This Labor government has continued on with our agenda to move  to a clean energy future We have pushed on I m suggesting that you re saying no In a statement lasting 13 189 minutes the minister failed to address the one issue the one question on the lips of everybody in this country concerned about a National Disability Insurance Scheme That question is simply this where is A fancy way of saying no A fancy way of saying no Is that what the minister at the table is suggesting Is that what the government is suggesting No we are not This actually nails the position of the government on this issue The minister at the table interjects and says that this is just a fancy way of the opposition saying no We put a billion dollars I also rise today to speak on the matter of public importance the unravelling of Labor s world s biggest carbon tax 8212 a tax that on the government s own admission will not reduce  s emissions On the Mr  on indulgence with a ministerial

8212 if Order The member for Casey will address 8212 I thank the minister I also thank the member for Casey for his contribution There has been too much conversation across the table It would be good for everyone in the chamber if there were less noise Mr  I rise on a point of order Indulgence is something to be used for certain things under the forms of the House It is a courtesy extended by the person in the chair it is not an My complaint is only diluted by the fact his cabinet colleagues have to put up with his juvenile behaviour by leave 8212 Our government has worked hard to make child care more affordable more accessible and better quality for n children and their families That is why we are investing a record 22 3 billion over the next four Order The time for discussion has concluded It was no surprise to me at all to hear my Tasmanian colleague Liberal Senator Bushby talking down the economy and in doing so he is talking down the economy not just of this nation but also of his home I present a supplementary explanatory memorandum to By leave 8212 I move government amendments 1 to 3 as circulated together 1 Schedule 1 item 3 page 3 line 24 at the end of the definition

Young Senator Joyce I remind you of the requirement to address your remarks through the chair Senators on my left and right I remind you of the obligation to allow senators to be heard in silence Is the amendment seconded I second the motion Let us find out if Senator Sarah Hanson Young has the capacity to go to the front call a press conference and announce that the Greens will withdraw their support for the government if this goes forward There you go The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Declared Fishing Activities Bill is not about the Margiris This bill is about unfettered and arbitrary powers that are an attack on every recreational fishing community and every family fishing operation in  I rise not to actually condemn a lot of what the Greens have said I think the Greens are claiming responsibility for the  in relation to the Abel Tasman There is an ad in the paper today that says Just like Cubbie Station Mr Acting  on a point of order I would like the record to be corrected You have not named me in any of these interjections Senator Joyce I remind you of the requirement to address senators Senator Williams interjections have come from  of the house The reality is that the n Greens do not have the ticker to make the difference to stop this 8212 they do not have it They know full well how they could do it There is not one person that There is  that when they make an interjection about Cubbie Station they know that they are on such thin ice and that what they are putting forward has become so ridiculous and so pathetic because I am

statements has concluded I rise to join with the  the Leader of the Opposition the Minister for Defence and all members that have and will contribute to this very important and sad condolence debate I rise therefore to pay tribute This is another dark day in the life of this parliament as I stand to speak today on the designation of the Republic of Nauru as a regional processing country This designation is being made by the Minister for Immigration I say at the outset that I totally support everything said by the Chief Government Whip A week or so ago I attended a dinner which was for a school reunion and when the apologies were read out one of It is another terribly sad occasion where we rise to commemorate and pass our condolences to these lost sons of  and their families It was one of the most tragic days as has been reflected upon in the n I think he should have a cup of tea The member for Herbert can have an opportunity if he requires I think he should too He should have a Bex and a good lie down absolutely I thank the ministers I thank  Garry Kerr from Anglesea for the representations he has made to me as a recreational fisherman I rise today to speak in favour of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Declared Fishing Activities Bill 2012 This is in response to the super trawler the vessel that was once known as the Magiris and now referred I found the speech by the previous speaker quite an important speech because she made many points about our humanity and about how this is a complex issue and she is absolutely right The art of government has always been It is in sad circumstances that once again we stand to acknowledge the loss of our best and our bravest This time tragically it is not one soldier but five On 29 August five n troops were killed in two I rise to speak with great sadness on the designation of Nauru as a regional processing centre I think it is a tragic irony that as we debate opening Nauru in fact it is already full It has capacity for I rise to speak about the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Declared Fishing Activities Bill 2012 proposed by the government I wish I did not have to Even though  has come to expect no bounds to the incompetence I too sadly rise to speak about the recent tragic loss of life in Afghanistan It was referred to in the media by the defence minister the CDF and  as our darkest day since Vietnam Lance Corporal I think it is a disgrace and a shame that the opposition is not supporting this bill that they are not supporting what is so clearly in line with community expectations and clearly in sync with community concerns 8212 that I rise also to speak to this condolence motion which was moved by the  and was spoken to by numerous parliamentarians before me I acknowledge the member for Moreton with regard to his very moving and fine I rise to support the comments of my colleagues on this issue and I congratulate senators Sarah Hanson Young and Christine Milne for the extensive work that they have done on this quite extraordinary situation that  finds itself in Can I associate myself with remarks of the  the Minister for Defence the Leader of the Opposition and all those other members of the parliament who have spoken in this condolence motion and express our sympathy to I am somewhat taken aback by the contribution of my good friend the member for Hindmarsh He states that the size of the catch and other issues have been raised and that there needs to be further science on the Yes good fisheries management not policy on the run like we are seeing with this in a government that again is being influenced by a an email campaign run by the Greens and GetUp That is what this is about Good fisheries management I rise with great sadness to speak on this condolence motion At the outset I would like to associate myself with the very eloquent words of the minister who spoke just before me We all in this place join together In rising to speak on this motion I would like to begin by focusing on the concept of deterrence by pointing out that on page 6 clause 21 of the Instrument of Designation of the Republic of Nauru as a Senator Whish Wilson are you actually speaking to another bill that is not before the Senate No I am speaking to an amendment Sorry continue I will quickly talk about why this is an important policy and I think you have heard from all my fellow Greens senators today about their concerns over the mental health issues particularly of having children 8212

Lance Corporal Stjepan Rick 8212 or Milo as he is known 8212 Milosevic who grew up in Quilpie in my electorate in Queensland some 800 kilometres west of Brisbane In reiterating to the Senate the integral nature of supporting this motion to designate the Republic of Nauru as a regional processing country I would like to address the amendments put forward by the coalition and the Greens and the  is that the amendment moved by Senator Cash be agreed to I too would like to talk on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Declared Fishing Activities Bill 2012 I support the amendment moved by  Hunt But let me first say that I am totally and utterly bewildered I join the House and all members in honouring Lance Corporal Stjepan Rick Milosevic Sapper James Martin and

tragically killed in action and their two comrades who were wounded in action during an attack I hear the member for Paterson Hopefully he is offering his support for the recreational and professional fishers in his electorate The father of a fisher from his electorate was the first person to hit my office complaining about this The member for Hinkler s contribution to this debate on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Declared Fishing Activities Bill 2012 was one of the most interesting I have ever heard He put a very strong argument for endorsing So why  did you vote in the Senate to approve it I rise to speak on the condolence motion for Lance Corporal Mervyn John McDonald and Private Nathanael John Aubrey Galagher in this case particularly for

their lives in Afghanistan with five soldiers killed in two separate incidents in one week in what has been called our darkest military incident I too rise to pay my respect for Lance Corporal Mervyn John McDonald and Private Nathanael John Aubrey Galagher If I may I would like to focus my remarks today on Private Nathanael Galagher or Nate as he was known I commend the member for Parkes on his

involvement with KGB agents Ivan Stenin and Vladimir Alekseev In 2010 Senator Rhiannon promised that a full  on her ASIO file would shortly be  Acting  I rise on a point of order In my speech I did not mention any physical characteristics of Mrs Rinehart and  should withdraw that imputation It is again an honour to follow Senator Cameron whose capacity to twist the words of a great n is almost

foreign investment in n resource management I particularly mention Cubbie Station and a supertrawler I also raise today concerns over announcements from some members in this As we focus on the AFL

accordance with standing order 43 the time for members 8217 statements has concluded I thank Senator Colbeck for his question The n Fisheries Management Authority as Senator Colbeck knows is an independent authority responsible for the sustainable management of Commonwealth fisheries I do have confidence in AFMA and the strength of the fisheries Mr Speaker has asked me to thank the honourable member for Lyne for his question  in relation to s for the crossbench and has provided me with the following statement to read in reply While pursuant to Standing My question is to the Minister for Agriculture Fisheries and Forestry Senator Ludwig I refer to the press conference that the minister held  with the minister for the environment in which he said he was introducing new fisheries  I inform the House that the Minister for Climate Change Energy Efficiency Industry and Innovation will be absent from  today and tomorrow for personal reasons The Minister for Infrastructure and Transport will answer  in relation to climate Mr President I ask a  I refer to the statement by the CEO of AFMA on 26 July that unwanted bycatch from non target species by midwater trawlers is exceptionally low How can the ministers claim that there My question is to the  I remind him that when the Howard government advised it would send asylum seekers to Nauru the number of illegal arrivals dropped by two thirds in a month Yet since this government If Senator Colbeck looked at the press release that I put out 8212 if he has missed something in the last couple of months in following the fisheries website 8212 he would also note that there is a bycatch strategy I remind the  that when the Howard government announced it would send asylum seekers to Nauru the number of illegal arrivals dropped by two thirds in a month Yet since this government s backflip on offshore processing The Leader of the House will  his seat The member for Cook will  his seat The Leader of the Opposition will begin his answer again   on a point of order the Leader of the Opposition is misleading the House with the term he is using and he should not be allowed to do so Order If people would like to hear the answer then perhaps they might give the courtesy of not screaming during people s answers The Manager of Opposition Business will  his seat As I have noted numerous times before provocation is not a justification for ignoring the standing orders The standing orders require people to be silent when people are on their feet Mr Pyne interjecting 8212 The Manager of Opposition Business I withdraw   but I make a serious point I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question He continues to be at war with the facts He is all about aggression and not about outcomes He is all about exaggeration and not about responding to this issue The Manager of Opposition Business will  his seat The Manager of Opposition Business will withdraw   on a point of order none of this could possibly be relevant to  he was asked which was about the failure of the government s offshore processing The Manager of Opposition Business will  his seat The  will return to  before the chair   on a point of order how is the opposition expected to sit silently while the Treasurer makes up complete lies 8212 I certainly will Every day for the last two years the Leader of the Opposition has been out there in one form or another conducting his horror show 8212 every day he has been out there doing a doorstop But   under standing order 98 I am entitled to take a point of order Let me say this I hear what you say about provocation not being an excuse but when has the Deputy  been called Mr President I ask a further  If the science is certain but the minister is uncertain is it correct that uncertainty then prevails Again I thank Senator Colbeck for his question Again it seems to me that the opposition missed the press conference  and what it actually entailed We are amending the environmental act to allow Minister Burke to deal with environmental Order I draw to the attention of honourable senators the presence in the gallery of the Swedish Parliamentary Committee on Taxation led by Mr Henrik von Sydow MP On behalf of all senators I wish you a warm welcome to My question is to the minister representing  and the Minister for Tertiary Education Skills Science and Research Senator Evans Can the minister advise the Senate how the Gillard government s record investments in education and skills and I thank  for his question because it is at the core of the priorities of this government Despite the global financial crisis this government has seen the creation of 800 000 new jobs and has invested at record Mr President my first  is can the minister advise the Senate on how recent budget cuts from coalition state governments put at risk the benefits of the Gillard government s investments Opposition Senators Opposition senators interjecting 8212 Wait a minute Senator Evans When there is silence we will proceed Whilst we are investing at record levels trying to meet the skills demands of the economy and provide record education opportunities for our young people these state governments are destroying that investment by taking money out at the other end The hypocrisy of you Senator 8212 day in day out saying Don t lift mining taxes You ll destroy jobs Yet where are you when the coal industry suffers under these attacks Honourable senators interjecting 8212 Order Senator Evans just  your seat Order I remind senators on  that interjections across the chamber are disorderly Minister continue Month after month they have come in here and said A price on carbon will destroy jobs Well tell me It is nothing like Campbell Newman All the lobbying says jobs will grow but Campbell Newman is going to sack Order When there is silence we will proceed Opposition Senators Opposition senators interjecting 8212 but nobody on the other side of this House gets that equation because they do not believe in protecting the environment They do not believe in all of the essential protections that we on this side of the House are My question is to the  I remind the  that the government backflipped on the carbon tax floor price and Contract for Closure backflipped on offshore processing backflipped on live cattle exports installed and then What drives this government whether it is the pricing of carbon or the declaration of marine parks is the national interest That is what drives this government That is what drove us to respond to the global recession and put The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is warned I understand how important it is that our sons and daughters and grandchildren can have the opportunity to throw a line in and catch a fish I understand the importance of that 8212 Mr Laming interjecting 8212 The member for Bowman will leave the chamber under standing order 94 a The member for Bowman then left the chamber Mr President I ask a further  I further ask the minister is he aware of any further risks to the Gillard government s record investments in education and skills These cuts by Liberal National state governments reflect the same agenda that the Liberal Party took to the last federal election which represented the Howard government s record failure to invest in higher education and failure to invest in vocational I thank the member for Throsby for his question because the n economy is a clear stand out in the developed world We supported growth during the worst global recession in over 80 years We avoided recession and we avoided The member for Sturt will desist using the prop The member for Solomon had better not even think about it In Queensland and New South Wales today people are waking up to the stark reality of the values that drive the Liberal Party 8212 indiscriminately wielding the axe particularly in health and education In Queensland there has been the loss My question is to the Minister for Agriculture Fisheries and Forestry Senator Ludwig I refer the minister to the government s knee jerk ban on the export of live cattle to Indonesia last year made without any formal submission going My question is to the  Will the  outline the importance of a measured approach to fiscal policy What are the risks to our economy of reckless cuts to front line services like education and I thank Senator Abetz for his continued interest in the live animal export trade Can I say that the government supports the industry and its trade and that is why we acted to put it on a footing Self regulation My question is to the  and it follows his previous answer Will the  confirm that his government has cut 750 staff from Customs 97 staff from the n Federal Police and 144 staff from In terms of the network tender I can reject the premise of that question I am sure I have heard Senator Conroy answer that comprehensively a number of times Again in relation to matters of claims by commercial entities they Mr President I ask a  Has the minister sought or received legal advice going to issues of compensation to Seafish Tasmania as a result of the government s latest backflip Does the government acknowledge that its knee jerk People are being asked to leave the chamber because they are not following the standing orders The  has the call and will refer to  before the chair Everybody here is aware they will not have their policies costed at the Parliamentary Budget Office On this side of the House we have been entirely transparent We are proud of what we have done with the public sector We Order The  will return to  We on this side of the House have a methodical approach to finding savings in the public sector We have been doing that in a responsible way over the time that we have been in government That is why we We now know why the shadow Treasurer did not ask this question It is because the shadow Treasurer has been going around the country saying that there are 20 000 too many public servants in  and he is going The member for Cowan will leave the chamber under 94 a His constant yelling across the chamber will not be tolerated The member for Cowan then left the chamber   I rise on a point of order on the matter of direct relevance Members on this side of the House are being ejected from the chamber for quite rightly asking the Treasurer to simply answer  Mr President I ask a further  Does the government s ban on live cattle exports to Indonesia and now its backflip on fishing add to the sovereign risk of investing in  s primary industries Order on my right Senator Abetz is entitled to be heard in silence Senator Abetz If not how does this kind of policymaking on the run help encourage investment and job creation As opposed to Campbell Newman s massive hike on royalties The n government supports investment in agriculture whether it be in live animal exports whether it be in fisheries investment whether it be in pasture whether it be in cattle stations That is because we support jobs in regional  My question is to Senator Evans the Minister representing  Given that the Tasmanian House of Assembly has passed the Greens bill enabling equal access to marriage for same sex couples in the event of that  passing My question is to the Minister for School Education Early Childhood and Youth Public Catholic and independent schools in the Chifley electorate are deeply concerned about the New South Wales government s education funding cuts Minister are you able to  was in order The minister has the call   I rise on a point of order Ministers can certainly be asked  about their portfolio responsibilities but  he has been asked about to do with the New South Wales government bears no responsibility to Order on  Senator Evans is entitled to be heard Senator Milne is entitled to hear the answer I thank Senator Milne for her question I suppose the first point to make is that I am not briefed as to the scenarios that  poses as to what possible responses we might have to a series of I thank the member the Chifley for his question The fact is that Labor has consistently invested in schools around  That is what Labor does We have consistently done it in New South Wales 8212 half a billion dollars Opposition Members Opposition members interjecting 8212 Against the hubbub I am asked  what does this mean Well I will tell you what it means cuts that will push up fees in non government schools in New South Wales cuts that will reduce support to As I said the Labor Party members will be having a conscience vote on that issue But in terms of expressing the view of the federal parliament the parliament will get that opportunity next week   I ask a  How is the planning to keep investing in schools in the Chifley electorate and across the country 8212 In answer to that question Mr President my first response to Senator Milne was to answer that question and say I did not have any advice on the scenario she painted I do not have that advice so I Mr President I ask a  I note the minister did not answer  about whether we would have the government ruling out a High Court challenge or clarifying  given that the move to debate it next Mr President I ask a further  I would ask the minister to take on notice for  s office  about the legal advice and to table any that there might be Has the Prime When the shadow Treasurer was asked  about waste he referred to education investment I say no more Time expired   on a point of order I simply ask how it can be directly relevant for the minister to be making things up that I have never said I thank the member for that  because it allows me to point out that in Chifley the support that the Gillard Labor government has provided to schools in the member s electorate is significant 137 million in 163 160 160 The minister will conclude his answer Mr President I am happy to seek advice from  s office as to the issues raised by  but I do not think we will be tabling legal advice if it exists on the sort of My question is to the Minister for Agriculture Fisheries and Forestry Senator Ludwig I refer to the minister s supportive statement in  on Monday regarding the trawler the Abel Tasman The minister stated 8212 Government Senators Government senators interjecting 8212 Order Senator Boswell just stop for a moment I need to hear you The interjections from my right are disorderly The minister stated that output controls such as the total allowable catch particularly individual transferable quotas are the preferred approach to fisheries management and that small pelagic fish species including localised depletion were unlikely and that the n Fisheries Management The fact is that the shadow Treasurer in his usual sloppy way is in fact making it up himself So let s just go very clearly through this The health minister has developed an excellent scheme to improve dental services My question is to the  Does the  agree with the health minister s statement that the newly proposed dental health scheme is an additional 4 billion expense for the budget which must be funded I thank Senator Boswell for his interest in fishing Nothing has changed I continue to support the independent regulator I continue to support the way it manages the fishery But talking about output controls and input controls 8212 correct me Order One of those areas is that in that instance they changed the entire law They went from input controls which is gear right through to output controls But there is nothing that has changed 8212 AFMA continues to enjoy the Contrary to some of the claims that have been made I am advised that large trawlers were invited here during the Howard government They invited one and I think that has been mentioned couple of times the MV Veronica and Yes that is right   I ask a  to the  8212 a very simple question According to his own budget papers is this new dental health scheme going to spend more or less over the next four Mr President I ask a  Seafish Tasmania has worked with Commonwealth officials for seven years It has met all of AFMA s regulations and now finds the rules have suddenly changed Is the government prepared to offer compensation Factored into the budget bottom line is the abolition of the chronic dental scheme That is what we have factored into the budget bottom line and we put out there our new scheme and we have said we will find I thank the honourable member for his question and his interest in housing This is a very important area of public policy and it is for that reason that recently at the ministerial council that was held in Perth I My question is to the Minister for Housing What is the government doing to increase the affordability of housing In addition to striving to keep interest rates low shouldn t there be a national housing plan under which the release I thank Senator Boswell for his  In terms of the commercial decisions by the operator they still remain and have a total allowable catch for a particular fishery which is the small pelagic fishery Nothing has changed within Mr President I ask a further  Isn t  s decision to change the rules midstream a repeat of last year s live cattle fiasco when the government without any prior warning suspended trade to Indonesia Why would I thank Senator Boswell for his question although I have answered this a couple of times today His question misses the point What we did with live animal exports over some period of time was to move from a place I have been informed we have the mayors of Mount Isa and the Gold Coast in the gallery today I welcome them to the House Honourable members Hear hear Mr President my question is to the Minister for Human Services Senator Kim Carr Following the deep cuts across the board in Queensland s budget announced  by the Liberal National Party government what impact does the government anticipate on My question is to the Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation I am really concerned that the New South Wales government s budget funding cuts are hurting every school in my electorate Why is it important that governments manage I thank Senator Furner for his question This Labor government is one that faces up to its responsibilities when it comes to helping people This is in very sharp contrast to the position that has been argued on the other I thank the member for Parramatta for her question This government understands the importance of managing the budget for all ns That is why we are making responsible savings in order to return the budget to surplus this year But Mr President I ask a  What s has the minister received from New South Wales about the impact on service delivery   I ask a  The minister has talked about the impact of government fiscal policies on education What does this mean for schools in my electorate Mr President Premier Newman may well have set a new record when it comes to radical social engineering in this country but he is rivalled by the actions we have seen in New South Wales 8212 the wanton destruction that Senator Kim Carr you might just  your seat for a couple of minutes A few people are excited When there is silence we will proceed Honourable senators interjecting 8212 If you wish to take up the time of question Mr President I ask a further  Has the minister received s from Victoria about impacts on service delivery I am disturbed to have to  to the Senate that whenever the Liberals are in power and Victoria is no different we see the same thing They are about undermining people s capacity to get a fair go in Honourable Senators Honourable senators interjecting 8212 We know that Phillip Blond and his Red Tory philosophies are now deeply embedded into the approaches being taken by conservative governments across this country In Victoria we have seen the Education Maintenance Allowance halved we have seen the School I know that the member for Parramatta cares very deeply about all of the schools in her electorate She is right to ask  because the impact of these cuts will be devastating It will be devastating and it The member for Aston is warned by the executive director of Catholic education Mr Gregory Whitby who I also had the opportunity to speak to today In his letter he spoke about what the impact of these cuts might be He said that this decision will Order The  has the call and the parliamentary secretary 8212 and he knows who I am talking about 8212 is warned My question is to the  Will  rule out introducing death duties Government Members Government members interjecting 8212 The member for North Sydney is denying his colleagues the call   reluctantly I raise a point of order A  is meant to arise from the answer in this case of the  The  gave a very clear answer It is not   I have a  Given the  s equivocation and refusal to rule out death duties is he planning 8212 Order The member for Mackellar will  her seat and I will have silence The member for Mackellar will commence her question again Yes The member for Dickson is warned I think that question just demonstrates how far those on the other side of the House will go to run a fear campaign I refer the  to the answer that I gave in the House  and the We know what you re up to Swannie Well it is quite frankly I thought we would have had bipartisan support to make sure that we have the best possible people available I thank Senator Colbeck for his continued interest in the board What we do have is a process to go through to reappoint the existing board That does not mean that the board does not continue to operate I have  is in order The  will answer    on a point of order  is out of order  is out of order because the original question was fully answered The  refers to an answer that was not given Thank you very much   Given the  s refusal to rule out death duties will he now rule out any increase in income tax to fund his 120 billion great big budget black hole 8212 I am going to allow the member for Mackellar to start her question again Her question is in order She will be heard in silence In regard to the point of order 8212 It expired two weeks ago The Leader of the House will  his seat I thank Senator Colbeck for his question The Fisheries Research and Development Corporation continues to operate and continues to do a very good job across all of the work that it does It is a shame that you want to My question is to the Minister for Agriculture Fisheries and Forestry Can the minister confirm that the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation is currently operating without a board and can the minister explain how this situation has come about Government Members Government members

answers  has been fully answered The supplementary 8212 Mr President I raise a point of order in relation to direct relevance I know there are sometimes marginal cases in here but in answer to  does a particular named statutory authority have a board it is hardly The minister has been going for only 32 seconds I am very conscious of  and I am listening closely to the minister s answer The minister has one minute and 28 seconds remaining to address  I thank Senator Brandis for his slight interjection and helpful comment In terms of the management of the board we are going through a system of replacing some members of the existing of the board But let us be clear There is no such hole  I made that point  I made it the day before I said it was a shoddy piece of journalism in the Financial Review I know that they will continue to repeat it The member for Herbert is not in his seat He is going to behave isn t he My question is to the Minister for Health Minister today families in my electorate are reeling from cuts announced in the Queensland budget to jobs and front line health services What impact will these cuts have on health services and   on a point of order it would be helpful if the minister were to refer to the member by their seat not by their name and act in accordance with the standing orders Before I call the next question I inform the House that we have present in the gallery  8212 Honourable members interjecting 8212 This is ridiculous I am trying to welcome visitors and you are not even giving me The Deputy Leader of the Opposition s point is valid Individuals must be referred to by their seats Order The minister for health has the call I thank the member for Petrie for her question I know that as a proud Queenslander she is very worried about the effects that these cuts will have on people living in her electorate and living in Queensland For weeks Members opposite should read the Townsville Bulletin AS Townsville s already stretched public hospital staff face an uncertain future Premier Campbell Newman has announced a flash new Brisbane office for himself and it s not a good look Mr President I ask a  On 2 November last year the minister advised the Senate that the Grains Research and Development Corporation was operating without a board Can the minister explain how once again we find ourselves with So the member for Dickson the  for health and ageing 8212 Resuscitating Queensland Health This is a great one He is congratulating the Queensland government for these cuts And 8212 wait for it 8212 this is the best I thank Senator Colbeck for his question The work of the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation is second to none in this area The opposition know that Perhaps it is worthwhile explaining how it works What we have is a Mr President I ask a further  Minister is this the latest failure of you to provide proper oversight and governance another example of your disinterest in the portfolio or is it indeed evidence of your reduced influence in I thank Senator Colbeck for his  It is one of those areas where Senator Colbeck has been perhaps negligent How many times has Senator Colbeck moved out of his comfort zone in Tasmania to be able to engage The Manager of Opposition Business will  his seat I have allowed other  that have not begun 8212 you need to listen more carefully occasionally 8212 with the argument Perhaps if you could commence  with  My question is to the  Why has the government handed 72 000 to the Auburn Community Development Network to host an enviro tea salon and a weaving workshop to promote the carbon tax if the government is The last part of  was out of order The  has the call and if the opposition was serious about  they would actually allow an answer Opposition members interjecting 8212 All I meant was The member for Bennelong will commence his question again without the introduction of the argument Mr Hockey interjecting 8212 The member for North Sydney does not get to determine 8212   I rise on a point of order Up to this point none of that is in order it is pure argument and it is not true My question is to the  If the government is serious about funding its 120 billion great big budget black hole and cutting back on waste why has the government handed 8212   I raise a point of order With the greatest respect the government has been talking about things that the opposition have never said in their answers and in their  for the last five years If we I inform the House that we have present in the gallery  members of the Swedish parliamentary committee on taxation On behalf of the House I extend a very warm welcome to the parliament today Honourable members Hear hear My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer Senator Wong I refer to revelations on ABC TV s 7 30 last night and in Fairfax newspapers today regarding the Reserve Bank of  s knowledge of serious allegations of I thank Senator Xenophon for  and making sure I did not have  time without  at all today I am aware of the s on the ABC s 7 30  last night As the Mr President I ask a  I am happy for the minister to elaborate on the earlier answer but does the minister concede that these fresh internal s appear on the face of it to contradict the parliamentary committee This government is very serious about fiscal policy And we have proved that every year that we have been in government We have put in place a fiscal policy which has had the big tick from the OECD from the I thank the member for McEwen Mr Tony Smith interjecting 8212 Order The member for Casey is not assisting the dignity of this parliament Maybe I will send all the emails I get at the end of  to I withdraw The member for McEwen will withdraw On a point of order   the member for McEwen made a highly inappropriate comment and he should withdraw I table the full list of Queensland Public Service redundancies so that those opposite can see where people are being sacked   I seek leave to table an article from the Financial Review detailing the 120 billion black hole Mr Mitchell interjecting 8212 Leave not granted I am talking about the importance and seriousness of fiscal policy Those on that side of the House do not have one and they are unfit for high office As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was making her way to the dispatch box I was already asking the  to return to  On a point of order   this would be as relevant as talking about the vandalism of an electorate office in 1996 If that is not relevant how can this possibly be Order The  will return to  It was  about fiscal policy   and I am answering it directly Nothing could be more important to the peace of mind of the n people than a very sound fiscal policy But that is not The member for Cowper will  his seat The  has the call   I rise on a point of order on relevance  was about the weaving workshop and the tea salon First as  would know the AFP is an independent body and is not directed by the government in matters such as the one he has referred to I would also make this point the RBA has taken steps Mr President I ask a further  I am grateful to the minister Can the minister advise whether the government has sought to ask the n Federal Police to investigate whether the RBA failed to alert police in a What that question is putting to me is that Campbell Newman just could not help himself It s all your fault He could not help himself when he cut 14 000 jobs He could not help himself when Who said this Order You are entitled to be heard in silence Senator Cormann and when silence returns to the chamber I will give you the call Order on my right This is the Queensland Resources Council that well known bastion of Labor values It risks further mine closures and there are many coal s on the drawing board that will now never get off that drawing board But what do I thank the member for Hughes I withdraw The member for Hughes will withdraw for the assistance of the House For the benefit of the parliament 8212 I withdraw But what did the nurses in Townsville ever do to deserve Premier Newman cutting their jobs What did the hospital orderlies and the school cleaners and the people necessary to make sure we have healthy hospitals do Fairness Order The minister will withdraw the reference to the Premier It was unparliamentary In the Queensland rural fire service 45 out of 79 uniformed officers are being cut What a recipe for disaster to cut fire officers before what is potentially one of Queensland s worst bushfire seasons What did the public servants Voted Labor I thank the member for Greenway for her question The Labor government and the labour movement are always striving to promote fairness in n workplaces To support that proposition I would submit that it is this government which has been On a point of order   during the minister s answer when he asked rhetorically what various people had done to deserve getting the sack the member for Hughes yelled across the chamber Voted Labor Honourable members interjecting My question is to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations Financial Services and Superannuation How is the government promoting fairness in n workplaces and with all the job cuts announced by state governments in front line education and health The minister is in pain because she has to pay for the royalty increases Order That is arguing Ask  Mr President here is my  What is the total cost to the federal budget of decisions by governments in Western  New South Wales Tasmania South  and Queensland to increase royalties on iron ore and coal since As I said before it is interesting that those on the other side do not want to talk about the effect on employment of a Liberal royalty increase but they are happy to exaggerate and make false claims about the Isn t it extraordinary that Senator Cormann the great defender of the mining sector is not at all interested in that question nor in the one before about the impact on mining jobs in Queensland I am not surprised you Mr President I rise on a point of order and that is the requirement for the minister to be directly relevant to  There was a very specific question asked and that was what is the cost to the Order The minister has been addressing  for 17 seconds and there are 43 seconds remaining I invite the

glass jaw and regrets asking  but the minister is having a great deal of I am asked about the bottom line and the bottom line is this there are 14 000 Queenslanders who are going to lose their jobs as a result of your colleagues let alone those in the mining sector who on I thank the member for Hume for his question because what we have seen in this House day after day are allegations of that nature and they are generally always wrong They are always exaggerated they are always taken out Certainly  Hospitals do not pay the carbon price Yes there is an impact on electricity costs 8212 there is  about that 8212 but there is no direct imposition of the carbon price on hospitals And as The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will  her seat The  will return to  before the chair   8212 It is very interesting that it is no longer the Leader of the Opposition who asks these  He no longer asks these  and I wonder why that is the case I think he wants to separate himself from Where has the Leader of the Opposition been for the past week Mr McCormack interjecting 8212  Acting Speaker I ask leave of the House to table the  from the hospital which quite clearly shows that they pay carbon tax Leave not granted   on a point of order for the benefit of the  there is a military funeral on today 8212 a military funeral 8212 and that is why I thought it would be best not to Order the member for

were some outbursts from my opponents the Liberals over there There No you won t because you ll be relevant to You ll be relevant to so you won t actually thank you Thank you   The government bill in this case is a knee jerk reaction and a total overreaction despite the minister s comments It proposes that the minister have the power to suspend any fishery for a period I rise to speak on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Declared Fishing Activities Bill 2012 This government could not hold a line between the kitchen sink and the stove Really the backflips

The issue affects a huge proportion of my electorate particularly elderly residents receiving the age pension who often utilise Centrelink s I rise to continue my remarks on the Environment Protection Beverage Container Deposit and Recovery Scheme Bill 2010 I want to take the opportunity to run through a few facts and figures about waste in Queensland Unfortunately it is not Just over a week ago I had the honour of meeting Justin Kwon a year 5 student at St Vincents Primary School in Ashfield Justin s passion for prose saw him take out a top spot in the Dorothea Mackellar It is breathtaking the way the coalition has addressed this issue We obviously see the track record that they had prior to the 2010 election 8212 out there mendaciously misleading the entire electorate about the marine bioregional planning process in Why would anybody from that side stand up and oppose that Why would the member for Dawson or anybody else who has significant recreational fishing or commercial fishing in their electorate seek to oppose those people and those interests in You have taken that out of Absolutely I had the great pleasure of meeting with Recfishwest and the commercial fishing organisations in Western  the Northern Territory and Tasmania 8212 all over this great land We worked very hard to make sure we got the balance You need to come to the great state more often Brand

business 8212 to find that they have given the member for Dobell amendments to Order The member for Dawson will address members by their proper title 8212 as is in line with what you required  Poor old minister On Monday he was busy in the other place defending the supertrawler on behalf of the government 8212 backing up a decision the environment minister had made when he was fisheries minister to get the supertrawler over I rise to express my outrage at the very poor treatment that the residents of Western Sydney are receiving from the New South Wales Liberals We have seen in the last couple of days these devastating cuts to education 1 I rise today to speak about a fantastic not for profit organisation in my electorate Blue Mountains Cancer Help is an organisation that is dedicated to supporting people diagnosed with cancer in the local community Since 2005 more than 400 He was excellent I had a lot of dealings with him He was genuinely interested in workers jobs

On Monday we remembered the loss of three n soldiers who were murdered by a member of the Afghan I rise to talk briefly about the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Declared Fishing Activities Bill 2012 because I have a very keen interest in marine biology This bill draws a very stark contrast between Labor s view of A sombre ceremony is being held today at Pilliga a village a long way from anywhere in the north west plains of New South Wales You get a sense of the isolation 8212 some would say desolation 8212 of this Firstly I would like to acknowledge the most thoughtful and touching contributions by those who have spoken before me on  of this House We are in this chamber today to pay our respects to Lance Corporal Mervyn McDonald I rise to speak strongly against this bill in front of us It is not because I am enamoured of the concept of the supertrawler but rather for three fundamental reasons First in no good conscience could I support a I

following the condolence motion for Lance Corporal Mervyn John McDonald and Private Nathanael John Aubrey Galagher I would like to identify with the remarks made in that condolence motion It s all I have significant concerns about the operation of these factory ships these super trawlers not only in n waters but anywhere else The sophistication of these operations really does take the chance out of the fishing exercise They simply do I welcome the opportunity to contribute to a debate which enables us to shine a spotlight on fishing and the way we sustainably manage a precious resource in this island nation a debate which enables us to talk about the Your minister approved it The issues of housing availability affordability and access present critical challenges in  and these are issues on which I have spoken a number of times particularly with respect to tackling homelessness In the last 12 months I have been and they are clearly struggling with the NBN There have already been massive delays missed deadlines and broken promises The losers are the people of my electorate of Swan as well as the people of  who are still waiting I am having trouble hearing the member for Swan Last week the member for Wentworth and I went on a broadband policy tour of my electorate of Swan to meet residents and businesses We felt a bit like David Attenborough looking for a wild creature out in the wild I rise in the chamber to recognise and congratulate two outstanding athletes in my electorate of Bass one who is a world champion and one who will be a world champion These individuals have both reached the pinnacle of their I rise to make a very brief contribution to this debate on the Environment Protection Beverage Container Deposit and Recovery Scheme Bill 2010 8212

we are We are once again here debating  as a result of this government following GetUp deciding There has been a debate about foreign investment in this country recently which has got political and I think many misleading statements about foreign investment have been made I just want to outline our oldest agricultural company s history in This morning I am teaming up with the member for Shortland to express on behalf of the Hunter community collective concerns about the impact of the decision by Barry O Farrell Premier of New South Wales to cut 1 7 I accept that point of order The Liberals and Nationals cuts mean almost 1 800 jobs slashed in New South Wales and are gouging workers and students with an almost 10 per cent increase in TAFE fees and a whopping   I rise on a point of order The member should refer to the Leader of the Opposition by his correct title I will address Senator Thistlethwaite s considered contribution in relation to the constitutionality of this I do not necessarily accept the point that is being made by Senator Thistlethwaite but I think that even if that did have validity the I appreciate the opportunity to update the House this morning on activities within my electorate to protect and enhance the environment of the Gippsland Lakes I have spoken several times about the importance of the Gippsland Lakes and its catchment Having seen the schoolkids up in the gallery who are of a very similar age to my kids in Tassie it occurred to me that there is a contrast between taking action on cleaning up rubbish and what we are He said that I rise to join with my colleague the member for Hunter in expressing disgust at the New South Wales government s decision to withdraw funding for education in New South Wales I also call on the member for Paterson to I compliment the member for Wannon on his contribution today While he put a little bit of humour into the debate he raised very serious matters associated with the fishing industry in this country At the outset can I make It gets better Why Because AFMA will continue to apply sound policy to ensure that we will have sustainable fisheries now and into the future For those reasons

half 8212 that is the issue of local community safety We have been able  is that the Environment Protection Beverage Container Deposit and Recovery Scheme Bill 2010 be read a second time It was with a

role of the union movement in the governance of superannuation funds as a consequence of the so called equal representation model introduced by the Hawke Keating government under which the boards I rise to speak on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Declared Fishing Activities Bill 2012 This is a complete and utter joke I have been trying to keep track of the amendments being rushed in 8212 three lots As a parent of two young boys I am a high user of early childhood centres I remember with great fondness taking my then one year old to day care on the back of a bike These days I tend I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak today on this bill It is a bill that was crafted to ensure that public funds are invested ethically and not counter to the wishes of the n community invested I rise to speak on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Declared Fishing Activities Bill 2012 Like the rest of the coalition I

in at the last minute but do you think Mr  he could Order I ask the honourable Chief Government Whip to speak to Well some things do not change and that is the member for Mackellar s constant frivolous points of order in this parliament They may be very amusing for many in the House including those who sit on the other side Thank you Mr  I was discussing the arrogance of those opposite and

chamber and small businesses in  that yet another Labor broken promise is being inflicted on the engine room of the n economy In this parliament the coalition worked very collaboratively I rise in the House today to commend the excellent work that Centacare is doing in George Town in my electorate Centacare Tasmania Family Services have been active in the state since 1960 They provide a variety of counselling and I am sure the member for Hughes and the member for Barton will join me in congratulating the Southern Districts Rebels who will take part in their first grand final appearance in the Sydney rugby union premiership 8212 on Saturday I move That this bill be now read a third time Question agreed to Bill read a third time I thank  for his contribution and commend to the chamber

women leaders who do so much for our community Speaking on air with a coalition senator a Order It being two o clock we go to  without notice Mental health care is an issue that affects everybody stretching across generations and across socioeconomic groups In my electorate wide survey mental health care consistently ranks as one of the top priority issues It inspired me to host a Higgins A few months ago the mighty green machine otherwise known as the Canberra Raiders was written off by armchair critics and some sporting commentators Yet this Saturday night the Canberra Raiders will play the South Sydney Rabbitohs in the NRL I rise to congratulate my good friend Ned Mannoun who less than three hours ago was officially declared the new Mayor of Liverpool Liverpool is our fourth oldest settlement after Sydney Parramatta and Hobart and Liverpool used to be Labor I met recently with Jenny Dundas a local constituent of mine and her colleagues from the Baptist World Aid program Catalyst Catalyst is a program that empowers small community groups to speak up on behalf of the poor the oppressed Before the Canberra Raiders take on Souths the mighty Cowboys will carry the weight of the nation as they go in against bloody Manly Warringah It will be the mighty North Queensland Cowboys We already have a Cowboys flag flying Sir Richard Kingsland passed away at Calvary John James Hospital after a short illness on Monday the 27th Like many of my constituents his was a life of public service His wartime service was marked by the bravery and ingenuity Order In accordance with standing order 43 the time for members statements has concluded Mr President on the point of order once again Senator Brandis is rephrasing   commenced with a false premise It is very difficult for the minister to be directly relevant to a false premise My question is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation Senator Wong Given it has been confirmed that the Gillard government has paid 120 billion worth of unfunded promises creating a further 120 billion budget black hole on top of Thank you Mr President The point I am making in terms of making sure we demonstrate our funding commitments is the commitment by the government to honour the Charter of Budget Honesty That is the commitment I invite the shadow Mr President on a point of order about the subject of direct relevance we have been very patient while Senator Wong has indulged herself but with 21 seconds to go we ask her to direct herself to  It I thank  for his question The only confirmed unfunded promises and the only confirmed targeting for cuts is the 70 billion in cuts to services that the  for finance and the shadow Treasurer have both confirmed Order The minister is answering  The minister has 21 seconds remaining by leave 8212 I move That further statements on indulgence in relation to the London Paralympic Games be permitted in the Federation Chamber Question agreed to Oh nonsense Mr President I have a  Given the Minister for Finance and Deregulation has refused to rule out any further unfunded commitments by the Gillard government between now and the next election 8212 and given government revenue is down I am asked I think amongst that question 8212 Stream of consciousness is probably the most polite way to put it Thank you Senator Conroy That was a reference to taxation and I would remind  that he represents a party of a government that was far higher Stream of consciousness Order Ignore interjections They are disorderly Senator Wong I will take that interjection from Senator Abetz Thank you Mr President Even some newspaper representatives who have currently entered the gallery might recognise that the tax to GDP ratio might be a reasonably accurate way of measuring the level of taxation Who was the higher taxing Treasurer When  are asked with so much detail applying a direct relevance rule becomes quite difficult I will ask the  to return to  before the chair   I rise on a point of order If the relevance rule is to mean anything at all the Treasurer must be brought back to the actual question he was asked and not this extraordinary attempt to avoid Certainly First of all I was asked about the carbon price The government has put in place a carbon price to make sure we reduce carbon pollution and to drive investment in renewable energy Nothing could be more important to I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for that question because it is not a bad attempt to deflect attention away from the savage cuts that are being made to health and education right across Queensland the absolutely savage My question is to the  I remind the  that there have been seven changes to the carbon tax it was promised would never be introduced five versions of the mining tax live cattle exports Mr President I rise on a point of order going to relevance It is a very specific point of order and it relates to the minister s requirement to be directly relevant to  There was only one question There is  of order Order Senator Wong I have told you already in  today to ignore the interjections Senator Brandis interjections are disorderly and you know that I tell you what mate we will not be using a catering company which is the standard that you lot have set We will actually judge ourselves by higher standards the standards that Peter Costello set Senator Brandis interjecting 8212 The commitments we have given which you will not match is that we will comply with the Charter of Budget Honesty in the midyear update and in the budget and in our election costings 8212 something that your economic team What is disrespectful is the disrespect shown to the n community by those opposite who reckon they can come along and use catering companies to do their costings who use accountants who have been found to have acted unprofessionally and Mr President I have a further  Can the minister give a guarantee to the Senate here and now that the upcoming Mid Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook will detail all the necessary spending cuts required to fill the I thank the member for Fowler for that question because the n economy walks tall in the world Our economy is now 11 per cent higher than when we came to office and of course we have done that during Mr President my question is to the Minister representing the Minister for School Education Senator Kim Carr Given the joint responsibility of the Commonwealth and the states for school funding how will the government respond to the 1 7 billion I do understand why they are so sensitive because they are going to take the axe to basic services and they want to keep their agenda hidden just like Campbell Newman kept it hidden in Queensland That is their objective and the member for Canning is warned Certainly The Deputy  will refer to people by their titles 8212 Mr Randall interjecting 8212   I raise a point of order The Deputy  ought to know by now that you address members by their seat not by their name and I find it offensive that he continually flouts the standing My question is to the Deputy  Will the Deputy  outline why it is important to invest in reforms to keep our economy strong Senator Cameron thank you for your question In a year when the Commonwealth funding for schools is increasing following upon the 50 per cent increase in funding this government has provided for schools it is a tragedy to see the Order When there is silence we will proceed Senator Cormann interjecting 8212 Senator Wong interjecting 8212 Order This is not the time to debate the issue Labor takes the view that education opens the doors of opportunity for ns Labor takes the view that it unlocks the doors of inequality Labor takes the view that education has to be the first priority of government However that Mr President I ask a  Does the Commonwealth remain committed to school improvement in  Mr President the answer is yes There is irrefutable evidence that investment by governments has made a difference Look at NAPLAN It confirms that literacy and numeracy have improved attendance has improved Opposition Senators Opposition senators interjecting 8212 No The member for North Sydney has asked his question Gross debt 2011 12 265 8 2012 13 274 2 Honourable members interjecting 8212 The Deputy  has just demonstrated amply for me why everybody in this chamber should pick up the standing orders and read 65 b The Deputy  has the call and will be heard in silence Gross debt On a point of order   before I ask my  I ask the Treasurer to table the  he was reading from   on a point of order I could not hear when the Deputy  said 265 I could not hear him I also wanted to make some 8212 Net debt 2011 12 142 5 billion 2012 13 143 5 billion My question is to the  What is the current level of Commonwealth government debt today in dollar terms Was the Deputy  reading from a  Order Thank you  because I am only too happy to talk about debt I am very happy to talk about it Net debt in  as a percentage of GDP was 9 6 per cent in 2011 12 That This is the twisted fantasy of the Red Tories Those who subscribe to Phillip Blond s 19th century idea of social policy The New South Wales Minister for Education actually said I sleep very well at night knowing the decisions Mr President I ask a further  How does the government respond to the suggestion by the coalition New South Wales Minister for Education that the cuts are in the best interests of students across all schools Thank you Can the minister 8212 that is Senator Wong 8212 confirm that the latest Treasury budget analysis shows that the government is heading for cumulative deficits of 100 billion over the forward estimates on the back of declining commodity Order You are entitled to be heard in silence Senator RonaldsonSenator Conroy interjecting 8212 It is disorderly Senator Conroy to keep interjecting As I said you won t be quite as chirpy in a second  My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer Senator Wong Can the minister confirm that the latest Treasury budget analysis 8212 Government senators interjecting Yes you are quite within order I will start again Mr President so that there is  about  Order Senator Ronaldson I go back to where we started You are entitled to be heard 8212 Government senators interjecting 8212 On my right Senator Ronaldson is entitled to be heard in silence Senator Ronaldson continue You won t be quite as chirpy 8212 Here we go 8212 putting forward the shonky figure which appeared on the front page of the Financial Review It is simply untrue I stand by all the commitments we have given   I ask a  Does the Treasurer stand by the commitment he made on 21 May that government debt will be within the 250 billion cap If so is he ruling out borrowing more to fund My question is to the Minister for School Education Early Childhood and Youth Will the minister please outline the importance of government making the right choices to support school students and their families In reality I think Senator Cormann should have asked this question The reality is that the forward estimates  an underlying cash position of 1 5 billion in 2012 13 2 billion in 2013 14 and 5 3 billion in Opposition Senators Opposition senators interjecting 8212 Senator Wong continue Mr President I raise a point of order on relevance I asked the minister whether we are or are not heading for cumulative deficits of 100 billion over the forward estimates It was a quite clear question Yes or no This is something of which the country can be proud Senator Abetz of which the nation can be proud We have come through a very volatile period of the global economy in a very good position In terms of our Thank you  referred to the latest Treasury estimates The latest Treasury figures are the published budget figures which do not include the figures that I think  was referring to I remind him that in terms of This Labor government has a proud history of investment in schools But what we build up the Liberal Party is intent on tearing down We are seeing the biggest cuts to education in New South Wales in decades 8212 the Self praise is no praise The minister has 27 seconds remaining to answer  I do draw the minister s attention to  Senator Cormann interjecting 8212 I am not sure what that question actually was because I think  was that the latest Treasury estimates 8212 Mr President I ask a  I know when the arms are crossed that we are getting through Can the minister confirm that the latest Treasury analysis shows that on current numbers the government will deliver a 25 billion   I ask a  Minister how is the government supporting schools in my electorate of Page and what would be the impact of cutting school funding I thank the member for Page for her question The Gillard government s investments have seen 29 libraries 19 multipurpose halls 42 classrooms six trades training centres and 9 000 computers delivered to the schools in her electorate The Gonski It is not rubbish It is what you did These are the people who use accountants who have been found to have acted unprofessionally and the people who refuse to comply with the Charter of Budget Honesty because they do That s rubbish Penny Mr President I refer to my first answer in response to that I have no idea on what basis Senator Ronaldson is creating a range of figures to put to me This perhaps is the same approach that we see Mr President I ask a further  and there is still no denial in relation to those figures Why should anyone believe that the government would do better this year than last year when Labor s budget deficit for My question is to the Treasurer Government members Oh Don t be so disappointed in him he will give it a go I refer to Labor s claim that it will bring the budget back to surplus this financial year Order The honourable member for Dickson was warned about props I give the same warning to everybody Senator Wong  your seat If you wish to debate it the time to debate it is after  not now Senator Cormann interjecting 8212 Order As I was saying what is astonishing about the coalition is that not only do they completely ignore any requirement for costings any requirement to comply with Peter Costello s charter of budget honesty not only do they continue to Mr President I ask a  My  goes to the heart of the first question Tomorrow the first load of refugees will be leaving  What assurances has the n government given the Nauru government that force What is always astonishing in this place 8212 Opposition Senators Opposition senators interjecting 8212 The member for Dickson will  his seat Mr Dutton interjecting 8212 The member for Dickson is warned Abuse of points of order will not be tolerated Introduction of argument into  or points of order will also not be The Treasurer will return to  Certainly I was also asked about the economy Opposition members interjecting 8212 I am sorry 8212 if you cannot understand  from the member for Dickson you are not going too well I was asked about an alleged hole   I seek leave to table this article showing Labor s 120 billion blowout I am sorry he refuses to rule out cuts to health and medical research No leave is not granted I table the media release entitled NSW bishops unprecedented threat to Catholic schools from the Catholic Education Commission My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship Senator Lundy Given the requests from the Foreign Minister in Nauru that  does not use force to remove refugees who are being deported to Nauru what   I rise on a point of order on relevance The Treasurer was asked to rule out cuts to health and medical research He refuses to do that He tried to cut it last year and with his The  has the hide of a rhino He comes in here and wants a guarantee from me that there will not be cuts in certain areas when he has said nothing about the savage cuts in Queensland to I thank the member for Dickson for his question about the n economy and about his allegations of a black hole The only black hole around is the 70 billion crater in the Liberal Party s bottom line that the The government has agreed in principle to implement the recommendations of the expert panel on asylum seekers and these recommendations cover the regional processing in Nauru and PNG on the principle of no advantage This is part of a broader Mr President I rise on a point of order 8212 that of relevance This is a critical issue The minister has been asked directly about the procedures for removing asylum seekers from the plane when the Nauruans have said they Mr President on the point of order when the minister was interrupted due to the point of order being made she was discussing directly the agreement between the n government and the Nauru government for the transfer of people to There is  of order The minister has 41 seconds remaining We are not going into any detail about the operational arrangements of transfers Section 198AD refers to the taking of people to a regional processing country and provides that certain actions may be taken to effect a transfer including placing No no 8212 there would only be one member of this House that could possibly apply to  Burke and I withdraw any reference to you in that respect My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Agriculture Fisheries and Forestry Minister with the fisheries hat on do you acknowledge the precautionary principle is already written into the Fisheries Management Act 1991 and if so in the Whether it be because of AFMA s  or because of their own actions I do not believe they have been precautionary enough  asked by the member for Lyne goes to that final question to which I sought an answer when I was working out whether part 10 of my  would be activated It was  of what the Thank you Opposition Members Opposition members interjecting 8212 I am sure the minister does not think I have mentioned the Tasmanian tiger Correct A week and a half ago I had not received the information that came in the last 24 hours But if we want to talk about events 80 years ago you are the one who thinks Tasmanian tigers are I do not think Senator Hanson Young listened to the first response I am certainly not in a position to confirm any transfers taking place We are determined however to implement the recommendations of the Houston panel to stop the The member for Cook is warned Those opposite ask why we are forming this view of AFMA AFMA themselves in the last 24 hours have ed to the government legal advice that they have been implementing some aspects of the act incorrectly Members have heard me That s not what you told Q amp A a week and a half ago Mr President I ask a further question What force is reasonably necessary 8212 Tasers gunpoint drugging batons I think it is an absolutely essential question considering the President and the Foreign Minister of Nauru have ruled it out I can only describe that question as both inflammatory and disappointing in the context of the serious efforts this government is making to try and effect the safe and effective transfer of asylum seekers to Nauru We are implementing this My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Regional  Regional Development and Local Government Senator Conroy I refer the minister to s that the government has frozen 2 billion worth of grants as a result of a I congratulate Senator Joyce on campaigning in his own portfolio area The government is building on the 4 3 billion investment announced in the 2011 12 budget by continuing to invest in regional health initiatives education liveability skills and infrastructure There is  of order I thank the member for Capricornia very much for her question I was very pleased to be in Sydney this morning with the  the Leader of the Opposition and others to welcome home from London our Paralympic Thank you Mr President As I was saying 1 5 billion for the Remote Jobs and Communities Program to provide a more integrated and flexible approach to employment and participation services for people living in remote areas of  a Thank you Mr President As I was saying 524 million to strengthen  8217 s biosecurity system which underpins our unique biosecurity status 8212 Time expired On the point of order Mr President Senator Conroy is exactly responding to that question by detailing the delivery of the commitments made to regional  He is providing the detail of those commitments of the delivery of those commitments Once more I have a point of order on relevance Mr President He is reading out a form guide but he is not answering  is he going to deliver all the promises to regional  in the time The minister is answering  The minister has 55 seconds remaining I rise on a point of order Mr President obviously on relevance and maybe he has got the wrong briefing note or he is just making it up  is are you going to deliver all promises to regional As I outlined in my earlier remarks we are starting the National Disability Insurance Scheme in many parts of  Unfortunately that certainly will not be happening any time soon in Queensland because of the absolutely devastating attitude of the The member for Bradfield might be winding something back very soon 8212 his presence in the chamber Once again I think the member for Capricornia for her question and for her advocacy on behalf of people with disabilities in her electorate in central Queensland 8212 Wind back the charisma and give us the facts Mr President my supplementary is also to the minister I note Minister Crean s statement this morning that it is not a freeze but a stocktake Can you please explain exactly what you mean by the word stocktake What is Mr President I know exactly what is in the budget and as has already been pointed out I am going through it point by point because Senator Joyce is too lazy to bother to read the budget papers So 225   I ask a  Can the minister update the House on how the government is working with state governments to deliver the National Disability Insurance Scheme and what are the challenges in this particularly in my I am reliably informed that we have representatives from the South East Queensland Council of Mayors in the gallery today I welcome them to the House I am not sure what you call a collective of mayors 8212 dangerous or We have just heard the most peculiar definition of stocktake ever given in the parliament Yes I am getting to it So Minister let us be honest stocktake is just code for delay And the stocktake goes on 2 9 million to continue the reform process that the n and Norfolk Island governments are undertaking to build a more sustainable future for the island Then of course for rural and regional  there Yes Is stocktake just code for delay so that you are not actually going to deliver on your promises to the Independents Because you are not delivering on those promises don t you think it is time that they deliver This is a commentary so if you have got  8212 It is  we need Senator Joyce My question is to the Treasurer If the Treasurer disagrees with the 120 billion figure for his black hole does he also disagree with the Director of Budget Policy and Forecasting at Macroeconomics Stephen Anthony a former senior figure in I thank the shadow Treasurer for that question I would like to go back to basics here because I think it is very important We have put in place a responsible fiscal policy We have set ourselves the objective to   I rise on a point of order Labor just lost its AAA rating in South  Mate So you should be pretty thankful The member for North Sydney will raise the point of order   my point of order goes to relevance I would hope the Treasurer would be relevant to  The shadow Treasurer has confirmed yet again that he has given a big tick to all of the cuts in Queensland and New South Wales and if they are to come in South  because that is the federal Liberal The Colombo Plan brought 20 000 scholars from Asia to study in  during the fifties sixties and seventies It was a good product for its time Colombo Plan scholarships to  ceased in 1985 when the full fee paying My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs Senator Bob Carr Can the minister update the Senate on any plans to reinvigorate the Colombo Plan I thank the member for Reid for his question about a topic which I know occupies the minds of everyone in this chamber Every day on average six or seven ns die by suicide and many dozens more make an   on indulgence I want to join with the minister and offer the coalition s full support to the government s efforts in this regard I praise the government for the investment they have made and also thank The  Awards are uniquely identified with  Students under the  Awards are studying in fields critical to their countries futures For example scholarships for Myanmar specifically support health education and rural development 8212 three areas critical for Myanmar Mr President I ask a  Can the minister further advise the Senate on how the  Awards are better than the Colombo Plan My question is to the Minister for Mental Health and Ageing Opposition Senators Opposition senators interjecting 8212  ought to be congratulated on such a percipient question  Awards alumni include students from as far back as the Colombo Plan people like Vice President Boediono of Indonesia You might recall that I recently had the honour Mr President I ask a further  Can the minister advise of any particularly influential  Awards alumni that you may have met since becoming foreign minister Speak up I can t hear you 8212  of the Solomon Islands the Hon Gordon Darcy Lillo an  Awards alumnus who studied under an AusAID funded scholarship at the 8212 Opposition senators interjecting 8212 I can My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs Senator Bob Carr As a student of American history as well as Minister for Foreign Affairs does the minister place any weight on theories that the 2001 attacks on the World My question is to the Treasurer I reminded him that in January 2011 the NBN Co took over responsibility for broadband in new housing estates Will he confirm that by June 2012 18 months later fewer than 1 000 homes I do not know what information  is seeking but I think all rational participants in n politics would see September 11 for what it was an aggressive attack on the United States which justified what the Howard government I thank the member for Wentworth for that very rare question He deserves congratulations It is obviously because the deputy leader is at the table that he has actually asked  On this side of the House we do have a commitment to nation building We have a commitment to the NBN because we understand the importance of super fast broadband to the modern economy We understand that we need to Opposition Members Opposition members interjecting 8212 You do not believe in the NBN The Manager of Opposition Business is warned People haven t got telephone lines and you re making a joke about it I do not know what can be done about paranoia and conspiracy theories that circulate in politics I do not know whether it is possible to have a rational argument with people who believe in those propositions and I really Mr President I thank the minister for his comprehensive answer and ask a  Does the minister believe it is appropriate for parliamentarians to knowingly meets with groups like Truth Action Sydney which believe not enough is known about   I ask a  I refer the  to the Villa World housing estate at Mango Hill in Petrie whose residents have been without any fixed line telecoms for over eight months as they Mr President I have a further  Does the minister believe that the promotion by n politicians such as Senator Rhiannon of groups such as Truth Action Sydney is helpful in enhancing our international alliances including with the United I think the Senate should take account of all those occasions in which the coalition has voted with the Greens party to defeat measures by this government Based on that logic you are associated with those theories That would be Honourable Senators Honourable senators interjecting 8212 Mr President I have a point of order on disrespect to the chair shown by this minister Every time he speaks he turns his back directly to you thus diminishing your authority and the respect for the Senate and the There is  in order The minister has 11 seconds remaining Mr President respect for the chair is my middle name But I am tainted by some of the habits of the mother of n parliaments 8212 and if that offends my colleagues I offer my apologies

to the House This is an opportunity to raise awareness of mitochondrial disease to make people aware that it is quite common and that it I am compelled to speak on this motion from the member for Lyne because of its sheer audacious and sanctimonious terms of reference I find it unbelievable that the member for Lyne after two years of his so called agreement I thank all members who have made a contribution to this debate not only on this occasion but on previous occasions Those watching will have  come to the conclusion that there is no real enthusiasm for the work Thank you  Acting  So

within the community Today I would particularly like to highlight some of that work within New South Wales particularly in my I rise to support the motion before the House moved by the member for Cook The member for Cook s motion is very pertinent and self explanatory with a lot of information I will read out some parts of it I had not originally intended to make a contribution to this debate because my views are on the record In fact there was a dissenting  by Labor senators published some months ago which arose out of a bill that I am pleased to rise and speak on the motion that the member for Gippsland has put forward This is an area that plays a very crucial and critical role in the educational and awareness raising of ns in respect I support this motion on mitochondrial disease and I commend the initiative of the member for Cook in bringing it forward As a new mother I think I can say what a lot of other parents know When you are I want to thank the honourable member for Gippsland for providing members with the opportunity to talk about surf lifesaving clubs It is not the first time I have talked about them in this place and I know it will I also support the

better  Acting  Crossin I understand we are debating your bill today I find it a very serious debate In fact to me it is one of the most serious debates that we have ever had to face in Why not That

before the chamber The member for Wide Bay I would like to congratulate the member for Gippsland on bringing this very important motion to the House I would also like to acknowledge the role that the member for Bass has played over many years within surf life saving I move That the provisions of paragraphs 5 to 8 of standing order 111 not apply to the following bill allowing it to be considered during this period of sittings Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Declared Commercial Fishing Activities The government comes in here seeking to deal with a bill on an urgent basis but does not give any reasons in support of its motion What this government has done is indicative of the shambolic way that it treats Socially uncertain Yes Senator Payne socially uncertain 8212 that is all that is required On what basis would anybody seek to make an investment in our country with this sort of shambolic government You saw what they did with pink batts you Senator Bernardi interjects undoubtedly the uncertainty arose on Q amp A One wonders where In this debate about this particular fishing venture I note that we have had a senator whose great intellectual input has been I don t care Q amp A This disallowance motion seeks to overturn the increase in road user charges for heavy vehicles which came into effect on 1 July 2012 and which has seen heavy vehicle operators slugged by 2 4 cents with the charge rising from Mr  I support this motion and I am sure that you would as well I agree with the motion That this House 1 notes that with more than 150 000 members and 310 affiliated surf lifesaving clubs surf I thank the member and congratulate the club in her area for the awards they have achieved I now call on the surf lifesaver from Dobell I rise to oppose the irresponsible motion moved by the member for Wide Bay as it puts at risk the extension of a vital program aimed at improving heavy vehicle safety and in doing so threatens our nation s road I acknowledge your contribution Mr  to surf lifesaving not just here in the parliament by founding Parliamentary Friends of Surf Life Saving but by being a life member in Tasmania and by committing a large very important part I too would like to add a few comments to the motion moved by Senator Collins Just to follow on from the comments that were just made by my colleague Senator Abetz in respect of green policy and its impact I will take your interjection Senator Fifield I think Minister Burke s motion of no confidence in himself will be passed It was passed in the House of Representatives last week The best thing this minister could do is resign I wondered where he d got to It ll get up I think He s like Sergeant Schultz I think that is an insult to Sergeant Schultz Senator Bernardi I think Minister Burke s activities and actions go way beyond Sergeant Schultz I think that is an insult to Sergeant Schultz I have a bit of time for Minister Collins Senator Bernardi interjecting 8212 These former treasurers turn up in strange places Michael Egan was appointed by Minister Burke He appointed the AFMA commission that is overseeing this entire process So is Minister Burke in his rush to push this  through the parliament I move I move That further proceedings on orders of the day Nos 2 and 3 government business be conducted in the House Question agreed to I rise today to speak on the disallowance motion which is currently before the House on the Road User Charge Determination No 1 2012 made under the Fuel Act 2006 The road transport industry is of great significance to the Today I seek to remind the House that National Police Remembrance Day is coming up on 29 September Police remembrance is observed annually on St Michael s Day 8212 St Michael being the patron saint of law enforcement It is I rise to speak in favour of the motion moved by the member for Fowler and I commend the member for Fowler who is as he mentioned also the son of a police officer who has dedicated his entire working I have not been counting Far from this being a motion of no confidence 8212 and I remind Senator Abetz as I interjected at the time 8212 the statement of reasons for urgency was tabled when I gave notice of It is an honour to stand and support this motion about the National Police Remembrance Day I also thank the member for Fowler for the motions he brings before this House but importantly the work he continues to do advocating  is that the motion moved by Senator Collins be agreed to After 125 I suppose you need some respite No Senator Bernardi I have not gagged any debate on this occasion I am seeking to make some comments in closing That is not true The member for Flynn does not seem to understand what this irresponsible motion would do It is not to reduce the charge it is to take it to zero The government does not support this motion which puts at risk Opposition Members Opposition members interjecting 8212 looks at the previous years expenditure on roads It calculates it over a period of time and then works on the formula that was established by those opposite to say We ll recover the costs So our expenditure on the They now want to stop the minister from speaking on this motion The member for Wide Bay s motion would disallow the legislative instrument increasing the heavy vehicle road user charge as of 1 July 2012 What I say to Order Sit down and you might learn something The road user charge 8212 He s out of order and 8212 These shows how little this bloke understands The road user charge 8212 I rise on a point of order This is a motion about the disallowance of the road user charge This road user charge is not used to fund the roads that the minister is talking about so his comments are Settle down big feller For the benefit of the nongs opposite I have not spoken in this debate This is a motion from the member for Wide Bay The member for Wide Bay yet again shows his knowledge of economics and adding up I assure the member for Wide Bay if you have a fund that comes from this determination which we do the fact is this program It has been a pretty wide ranging debate I also rise to speak to the motion proposed by the member for Fowler on National Police Remembrance Day We are a tolerant society and we are an understanding society We are that way due to in no small part I rise to speak on this very important motion which observes and acknowledges National Police Remembrance Day Each year across  National Police Remembrance Day is observed at services held on 29 September It is on  that we I move That this bill may proceed without formalities and be now read a first time Question agreed to Bill read a first time The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Declared Commercial Fishing Activities Bill 2012 we are discussing today should be a concern to all ns because of the very dangerous precedent that it sets What is more whilst I have not I table a revised explanatory memorandum relating to and move That this bill be now read a second time I seek leave to have the  speech incorporated in Hansard Leave not granted I table the  I rise also to support this motion which supports National Police Remembrance Day which in Victoria we commemorate as Blue Ribbon Day  was instigated in 1989 and is held on 29 September which is the feast day of I am pleased to speak on this disallowance motion in the House tonight after the shrieking of the minister who had to leap into the debate because there were actually no government members prepared to speak on it 8212 the I m sorry 8212 I 8212 Hang on the member for Farrer has not got the call The member for Farrer would assist the chamber if she would accept the call from the Leader of the House who was down to speak I do not wish to be petty I will withdraw The Road User Charge Determination No 1 2012 slugs truckies with higher fees 8212 that is what it does If you were a small transport operator listening to the debate The member for Farrer would assist the chamber if she 8212 Mr  I rise on a point of order I ask that the member withdraw I am the minister I was always going to speak on this motion It was brought on by my motion Order The debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 43 The debate may be d at a later hour and the member for Lyne will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is d In the short time I have before 90 second statements I will put on the record that I am opposing government on this disallowance motion for different reasons than the ones that have been presented by the Leader of the We heard the scare campaign there at the end of Senator Abetz s speech We are coming for you next Recreational Fishers which is really a slap in the face for those recreational fishers who have run a very strong It is my very melancholy obligation 8212 to make good a promise to the member for North Sydney 8212 in informing the House that sadly the Southern Districts Rebels went down 15 to 14 to the might of Sydney University I rise today to note the fact that Saturday 15 September was the International Day of Democracy a day set aside by the UN General Assembly to celebrate democracy and remind us that the need to protect and promote democracy I rise to speak about the Chatterbox Challenge a challenge thrown out to people around Townsville and around  to help raise funds and awareness for people living with disabilities It is sponsored by a group of seven charities the I was disgusted by the placard held by one protester in Sydney over the weekend which read Behead those who insult Islam This is clearly an incitement to violence and something I never want to see again in this country I would like to take this opportunity to speak about National Police Remembrance Day which is held every year on 29 September The day holds great significance for the police forces in  New Zealand Fiji Papua New Guinea Samoa The Grand Final for the real NRL will be played in Newcastle on Sunday To my great joy my own former club the club my son plays for and the club my father and brother played for will contest that Go the Goannas I would like to extend my sympathy today to those employees affected by the decision to close the Gregory Coal Mine in the Central Highlands region of Flynn Gregory holds special significance for me I was fortunate I rise to speak about Premier Campbell Newman s upcoming visit to my home state of Tasmania It is an interesting choice to have Mr Newman as the keynote speaker at the Tasmanian Liberal Party fundraiser Why isn t the I want to talk about the changes to the ACFI funding model and what that has done to the small rural and regional aged care providers in my electorate This is creating a major problem for those small providers 8212 It is with great pleasure that I rise today to acknowledge a great Canberran John Hargreaves on his retirement from the ACT Legislative Assembly John was first elected to the assembly in March 1998 making him one of the longest Nobody wants 30 seconds The member for Dunkley take 30 seconds we still have 30 seconds My question is to the Minister representing  Senator Evans Can the minister explain why despite warnings from the opposition the government decided to issue a visa to Mr Taji Mustafa the United Kingdom leader of the extremist In 2007 under the previous government I also understand that Hizb ut Tahrir has not been proscribed as a terrorist organisation in  and is not proscribed in the United Kingdom or the USA In 2007 the then Attorney General 2007 I am just seeking a brief on that Senator I do not have a brief other than what I have read in the press Sorry Mr President 8212 someone has a brief to assist  I understand that this I understand it is the wish of the House to consider the matter immediately  is that the motion moved by the Honourable  be agreed to As a mark of respect I ask all present to signify I understand it is the wish of the House to consider the matter immediately  is that the motion moved by the Honourable  be agreed to As a mark of respect I ask all present to signify Over the weekend we saw some violent protests in the streets of cities of  I think all ns would be sickened by the behaviour we saw over the weekend I think we all condemn this behaviour in the strongest Mr President I ask a  I am aware that the organisation has not been proscribed but is the minister not aware that Mr Taji Mustafa has in recent years 8212 since 2007 8212 been responsible for the exhortation ns would have been shocked at the scenes of violence and intolerance on the streets of Sydney on Saturday There is no place in  for such behaviour and we condemn it in the strongest possible terms Ours is a I asked about the man I accept that The Howard government at the time made the point that it is a thin line between stupid extravagant language and language which is deliberately designed to incite violence or to threaten the security of the country It I understand the interest in this issue As I said this is an organisation where the previous government made the decision that they ought not be a proscribed organisation 8212 Mr President I ask a further  In light of the disgraceful riots in Sydney at the weekend 8212 incited by those who share with Taji Mustafa a view of exhortation to violence 8212 does the government now regret I will seek some advice on notice from the immigration minister and  back to the Senate about this particular individual as I think I made clear in my first response The government all sides of this chamber and I Saying Is anyone home is not unparliamentary but to assist the House I will withdraw My question is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation Senator Wong I draw the minister s attention to a  released today by the n Securities and Investment Commission warning that it is not sufficiently well funded to protect I inform the House that  and the Minister for Defence will be absent from  today and tomorrow They are in Western  to attend the funerals of Lance Corporal Mervyn McDonald and Sapper James Martin Thank you I was going to point out that we have not even got to  yet and I have already had to say Order which I thought was a bit ridiculous Is anyone home For the assistance of the House could the member for Canning 8212 I would ask the member for Canning to withdraw The Minister for School Education and Minister for Early Childhood and Youth will answer  on behalf of the Minister for Tertiary Education Skills Science and Research The Minister for Families Community Services and Indigenous Affairs will answer  relating Thank you Senator Milne for  The government made some decisions around the resourcing of ASIC I think in the last budget but I will check 8212 perhaps not in the course of this question but certainly afterwards 8212 My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship I remind the minister that the government granted a visa to hate preacher Taji Mustafa to speak at the Hizb ut Tahrir conference  despite the coalition requesting on numerous I thank the honourable member for her question  goes to an invitation from an organisation known as HUT for a conference that was held  HUT has not been proscribed in  and nor has it been proscribed Why not When the honourable Manager of Opposition Business asks why it has not been proscribed he might want to check with the honourable member for Berowra who said in 2007 when he was Attorney General that it should not be proscribed With respect to  I am not sure that I would use the verb in the way she has It is a matter of fact that we are a lower taxing government than the coalition That is a matter Mr President I ask a  I thank the minister for her answer and note her reference to the constrained fiscal environment So I ask when the government struggles to find funds to properly resource vital institutions like ASIC So it is okay to lead the way on the carbon tax 8212 The member for Indi It was quite a breath of fresh air last week I seek leave to table a letter from last Friday from the Leader of the Opposition to  requesting that a visa not be granted or at least revoked if it was granted The letter of 14 September Leave is not granted It has already been made public I seek leave to table to a letter I sent to the minister on 13 September the day before which has not been released publicly Perhaps the minister would allow that 8212 It is not within standing orders for someone who has not asked  about the issue to seek leave Order The member for Cook will  his seat I call the Manager of Opposition Business I hesitate to rise and with the greatest of respect during the latest fracas I believe you made a comment that I thought was offensive to the member for Indi and unnecessary and I would ask you to withdraw it The Manager of Opposition Business will  his seat The Manager of Opposition Business is reflecting on the Chair I was merely pointing out that under standing order 65 b the member for Indi who has just returned to the So it is my voice that is the problem I remind the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that this organisation is not proscribed in  or in like minded countries and the normal rules for entry of British nationals have applied   I ask a  Why did the minister grant a visa to Mr Mustafa a leader of Hizb ut Tahrir when this organisation has called for Israel s military destruction and at their conference in Sydney No the member for Indi is a constant interjector The member for Bass has the call Mr President I ask a further  I note the minister s answer there but given  s warning that Premier Campbell Newman s devastating Public Service job cuts are just a curtain raiser for what Tony I would make a few points Unlike some in this place we take the responsibility as a party of government of finding the funds for socially progressive policy and we have done so This is the government which has introduced My question today is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs Senator Bob Carr Can the minister advise what his response is to the violent protests in Sydney on the weekend following the release of the film Innocence of Moslems My question is to the Deputy  and Treasurer Will the Treasurer update the House on what recent international economic developments say about the strength of our economy and why responsible budgeting is important for keeping our economy and Attended by an estimated 100 people the demonstration was repellent to ns and repellent to just about all ns of Islamic faith One hundred people is a fraction of the estimated half a million Muslim ns  I branded the I thank the member for Bass for that important question because we do have significant challenges in the global economy We have many European countries in recession and we have weak growth in the United States And of course many   I rise on a point of order that goes to relevance The Treasurer was asked about international information about the state of the economy How could this possibly be relevant to  I was also asked about domestic fiscal policy We have put in place responsible savings built on our values Those opposite have an entirely different set of propositions which are built on their values Their values are ones which take The member for North Sydney will  his seat The Deputy  has the call Mr President I ask a  Could I ask the minister to update the Senate on the Obama administration s commitment to religious tolerance and engagement with the Muslim world In his 2009 8212 Opposition Senators Opposition senators interjecting 8212 You might mock the President but we are admirers of President Obama In his 2009 Cairo speech President Obama called for a new beginning between the United States and the Muslim world He acknowledged that no single speech can eradicate Mr President I ask a further  I thank the minister for his response and ask can he update the Senate on recent protest movements in the Islamic world and what are the implications for the government s commitment Senator Brandis should not be taking sides on the US presidential election because in doing that he is only following what  John Howard did so infamously Governments in transition countries such as Libya and Egypt will I am My question is to the Treasurer I refer the Treasurer to this electricity bill from Pitliangas Foods that shows its off peak power has increased by 83 per cent as a direct result of the carbon tax that has driven I certainly welcome  but I am sure it is not welcomed by the member for Wentworth The fact is we have seen the opposition come in here week in and week out making all sorts of inaccurate claims Order The Deputy  will return to  before the chair I am referring to the carbon price and the fact that the overall impact of the carbon price is 0 7 per cent less than 1c in every dollar The government have been up front We indicated what the impact   I rise on a point of order  was about whether the government will revise its modelling as this bill shows electricity prices have gone up by more than 10 per cent Not even the Leader of the Opposition now believes his own scare campaign Those opposite do not believe it any longer So we can continue to get these  with exaggeration and all of the hype but it is not I thank Senator Cormann for his continued interest in the price of carbon The EU 8212 and I think this is worth reminding those opposite 8212 was the first international carbon market in the world and is now one of Mr President my question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency Senator Ludwig I refer the minister to the government s decision to link its carbon tax to the European emissions trading scheme after The modelling of the carbon price is in the Treasury modelling and it is accurate I seek leave to table this  that shows how the off peak power price has gone up 83 per cent and across the whole bill a whole lot more than the 10 per cent you said Leave not granted I table the pamphlet from John Alexander prior to the last election that said he would campaign for the Parramatta to Epping rail link Mr President I ask a  Can the minister confirm that not a single European business with a direct carbon liability under their scheme will be required to actually purchase carbon permits covering their whole liability while in contrast   I ask a  Rather than denigrating and ridiculing the concerns of ns about the effect of the carbon tax on their livelihoods why won t you simply answer  will you revise the modelling What I can do is speak on what  is doing These linking arrangements do not change the overall access that n firms have to international units 8212 that is n liable entities remain able to meet up to 50 My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport Will the minister please outline the government s commitment to the duplication of the Pacific Highway and are there any obstacles to achieving full duplication of the highway by 2016 I thank the member for Page for her question She knows that we have already committed some 4 1 billion to the Pacific Highway which compares to the 1 3 billion over double the time 8212 12 years 8212 that Mr President I ask a further  Why does the Gillard government think it is fair to n businesses that they will be required to buy 100 per cent of their carbon permits for 15 years before their European Opposition Senators Opposition senators interjecting 8212 Coming from those opposite I doubt that very much Nevertheless if you look at the potential that is available the industries could in fact see the effective rate from 1 July go from 90 9 per cent to 97 per Let me reject some of the premises of s that have been put My question is to the minister representing the Minister for Health Senator Ludwig I draw the minister s attention to the Salvation Army s Alcohol Awareness Week initiative and to the  released today that shows over 4 million people I thank Senator Di Natale for his continuing interest in health warning labels on alcoholic beverages As I understand it he was referring to the Foundation for Alcohol Research amp Education FARE which released a  recently If he was Minister you raised the Parramatta to Epping rail link in your answer Can you please outline why it is important for the government to also invest in public transport in our cities I thank the member for her question We know that the promise to fix the Pacific Highway is in tatters What we have also seen both with the announcement on Saturday and the interview 8212 the train wreck of an That does step well outside the health portfolio It does appear to be  that should be properly directed to the Minister for Broadband Communications and the Digital Economy but I will take on notice that part of the My question is to the Treasurer I refer the Treasurer to this letter and electricity bill from Jamie Foster who runs Advantage Engineering in Braeside He states We will now have to pay an extra 1 200 a month to Mr President my  is this millions of ns are subjected to alcohol advertising every week while watching sporting events thanks to a loophole that allows alcohol companies to advertise during for example afternoon sports programs Does the government I am   We have put a price on carbon to drive investment in particular in renewable energy We have put in place a range of supports particularly for trade exposed industries and also for households In terms   I seek leave to table the transcript from Meet the Press on 16 August 2010 where the Treasurer says that the introduction of the carbon tax was a hysterical allegation Leave not granted The Deputy  will  his seat The Manager of Opposition Business on a point of order   I am struggling to realise how he could be relevant to  when he was in fact in favour of a citizens assembly before the last election He was in fact in favour of a carbon I certainly thank the member for that question because like many members of this House I have been a long term believer in putting a price on carbon and doing that through an emissions trading scheme Of course that was I table the Sky News n Agenda transcript from  with the Leader of the National Party It is a ripper Mr President I have a further  does the minister agree with the recommendation from the tax summit and from the Henry tax review that alcohol taxation should be implemented in such a way that alcohol is taxed according The Manager of Opposition Business will  his seat The Deputy  has the call and will refer to  before the chair I thank Senator Di Natale for his question It is an area that appears to canvass tax related issues outside the health portfolio I can take that part of  on notice and refer it to either the Treasurer My question is to the Minister for Tertiary Education Skills Science and Research and the Leader of the Government in the Senate Senator Chris Evans Can the minister advise the Senate on how the Gillard government s record investment in I thank Senator Marshall for his ongoing interest in vocational education in Victoria It is well known that the has made a record investment in skills and training in this country in order to support the states in I welcome to the gallery today the former Speaker of the House and member for Wannon the Hon David Hawker I thank him for being present I believe he has been out riding motorcycles and enjoying himself in Canberra today My question is to the Minister for the Environment and relates to the national partnership agreement with the New South Wales government on coal seam gas and large coal mining developments Given that the New South Wales government has now Mr President I thank the minister for that answer and I have a  Can the minister advise the Senate on how the Baillieu government s cuts to TAFE funding are impacting on my home state of Victoria I thank the member for New England for  The member for New England was involved in the negotiations right from the beginning on the establishment of the independent expert scientific committee As members would know who have dealt Order There is a debate going on which makes it difficult to hear the answer Senator Marshall is entitled to hear the answer It is true that the Victorian situation is the most dire What we have seen in Victoria is that the government have removed 300 million from the system an absolute savaging of the TAFE system At a time when they Honourable Senators Honourable senators interjecting 8212 Leaked cabinet s on the weekend showed the impacts of those cuts by the Liberal National government We are seeing campuses threatened to be closed around Victoria We are seeing courses closed We are seeing increases in student fees of What we know is that students will get less opportunity they will be charged higher fees and they will have to travel many of them a long way to get access to a TAFE The hits on the rural and Mr President I thank the minister for that answer and I have a second  Is the minister aware of the impacts on students of the Baillieu government s cuts I thank the member for New England for  and his ongoing interest in the issue My officials are still working through what the New South Wales media statements of last week will fully mean in a legislative sense   I ask a  Given the minister s answer in relation to the so called gateway process which I believe does not have any legislative backing does that process and the associated protocols meet with the Order The time for debating this is after  on  Honourable Senators Honourable senators interjecting 8212 My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency Senator Ludwig I refer the minister to the government s recent advice to  s small businesses through one of its propaganda pamphlets which tells I do not accept the premise of that question Clearly the opposition opposed the tax cuts to small business The opposition are in fact completely at odds with how they can help small business But let us start with the I thank the member for Petrie for her question and in particular for her advocacy for people with disability and carers in her part of Brisbane I know that she is campaigning hard to make sure that people in Queensland My question is to the Minister for Families Community Services Indigenous Affairs and Disability Reform How is the government investing to better support people with disability their families and carers What are the challenges to this historic investment I was also asked about challenges The biggest challenge sits right opposite because when you were in government you were the ones that cut disability care and support funding so that people with disability found their care and support disappear The manager of opposition business will  his seat The minister has the call  I rise on a point of order The minister was asked about the government s policies and what the government was doing Previous speakers have ruled as irrelevancies talking about other levels of government or other political parties Mr President I ask a  Does the government really think the best response to a small business dealing with the impact of its carbon tax is to close their doors How many small businesses will have to close I thank the opposition for their interest in the carbon price The largest single cost impact for small business though as identified by the opposition will be electricity This was analysed by both COSBOA and AIG but they suggest the My question is to the Treasurer I remind the Treasurer of comments from Victorian chicken meat boss Mike Shaw that the carbon tax has bowled over chicken growers with the triple whammy price hike with electricity up 13 to 16 Mr President I ask a second  Despite all the evidence why is the government persisting with the world s biggest carbon tax when it pushes up the cost of electricity the cost of living and the cost of One of the most disappointing things for me is that back in 2001 the Howard government first started talking to ABARES about an emissions trading scheme Why Because those opposite saw the need to reduce our emissions of carbon And My question is to the Minister for Health Will the minister inform the House what the government is doing to improve health care for all ns How does this compare with other approaches to health care investment If there have been unjustified price increases they should be referred to the ACCC Because as I have said before the overall impact on the economy is 0 7 per cent less than one cent in the dollar Yes it My question is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation Senator Wong She has been a bit neglected today Maybe Senator Cormann can ask  Order There will be no debate When there is silence we will proceed Can the minister outline to the Senate what the impact on the Commonwealth budget of lower tax receipts in recent years has been and how the government has responded to this That s because she did a runner from climate change Opposition Members Opposition members interjecting 8212 The  The member for Cook will  his seat The minister has the call and has the right to be heard in silence I want to thank the member for Blair for his question The member understands what it means to have a strong and vibrant health system In his electorate recently we have just committed 21 million for a new cancer centre If those opposite continue to assist with the baying of time there might not be any people left at the end of  It is highly disorderly The contrast in Queensland dentists sacked in the Brisbane Dental Hospital dental services downgraded at the Royal Children s Hospital and 1 4 million cut from the metro health oral budget And do you know what The Leader of the I thank Senator Moore for  It is the case that governments at all levels have had to adjust to lower tax receipts in recent years This government has responded by putting in place responsible savings measures and by We will continue to focus on bringing the budget to surplus responsibly and carefully focusing on getting our priorities right and focusing on fairness The contrast with the alternative approach by those opposite could not be clearer The coalition always The minister for 8212 Opposition members interjecting 8212 Order I am hesitating because I have been reading 8212 as we have been going along 8212 not in respect of  but rule 101C ii  critical of the character   a point of order on the two points that have been raised one by yourself and one by the Leader of the House In terms of dealing with the one from the Leader of the House the The Manager of Opposition Business on a point of order I think members of the public who are not in office and that is what the standing order refers to to give them 8212 if you want to read I am referring to the standing orders Mr Randall interjecting 8212   on the point of order notwithstanding the fact that the minister for immigration has indicated he is certainly willing to answer  I am concerned as Leader of the House about this There is a reason I will allow  in respect of the minister s responsibility I will deal with the tabling at the end of  My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship Does the minister accept that Taji Mustafa a leader of Hizb ut Tahrir is a member of a political movement directed towards non peaceful overthrow of another government such as Mr President I ask a  Can the minister outline any alternative approaches to tackling the challenges of tough fiscal conditions Will our government be following these alternative approaches Does the minister accept that Taji Mustafa a leader of Hizb ut Tahrir is a member of a political movement directed towards non peaceful overthrow of another government 8212 such as Israel s military destruction 8212 or holds extremist views The reason Mr Costello introduced the Charter of Budget Honesty was to ensure the public knew what they were voting for It was to ensure the public knew what the policies of the government of the day would be but Mr President I ask a further  Can the minister advise how the government s commitment to the Charter of Budget Honesty underlines its constructive approach to finding savings and how this contrasts with alternative approaches My question is to the minister representing the Minister for Defence Senator Bob Carr I refer the minister to this year s budget which saw a cut to Defence spending in real terms of around 10 per cent taking government The minister is being relevant to  Well it was presented here as a revelation A speech given on 23 August was presented as a revelation It is the first time it has been raised in the Senate The fact is that most savings being made in The speech was entirely consistent with government policy Indeed it elaborated on government policy The speech was entirely an expression of government policy As a result of the recent budget and the commitment 8212   on a point of order  was not about proscribed organisations it was about his own discretion For that reason he is not being relevant to  I am very happy to take that question from the member for Cook It goes to my powers under the Migration Act in relation to the character test and the public interest test In relation to that test I refer The minister has d his seat The Leader of the House has declined to give leave Honourable members interjecting 8212 Order There is a great deal of puerile behaviour that goes on in this place Leader of the House was leave granted to table the  In relation to the minister s personal powers these are to be exercised appropriately and carefully For the information of the House I have personally considered the character test on 38 occasions during my time as minister for immigration and What a research capacity they have got on the other side of the House The speech that is the core of  the speech being unveiled to the Senate today was given on 23 August The speech by Duncan Mr President I raise a point of order similar to the one I raised last week Do you rule that it is in order for speakers to turn their backs directly to you in your role as President Is that No leave is not granted I table the press release from  on 10 October 2007 supporting the Pacific Highway duplication by 2016 with matching financial commitment from New South Wales Would you expect it to be anything else There is  of order I refer to my previous statement it has been ruled by previous speakers that someone who has not asked  cannot seek leave to table  If he has an education question he can ask it now and Was it the member for Bass or the member for McEwen who just called that out or was it completely somebody else Somebody over there should fess up because I heard it and I want them to withdraw it Was I withdraw The Manager of Opposition Business will withdraw I thank the member for Banks for his question In the investment that the Gillard Labor government has provided in his electorate he can see some 107 s benefiting 46 schools with seven libraries 22 classrooms and 5 000 computers I withdraw Mr Gibbons interjecting 8212 It s the Beazley model you fool I seek leave to table a  in which Kim Beazley the former minister of education introduced the AGSRC which the minister describes as a flawed funding model The member for Sturt will  his seat Leader of the House is leave granted My question is to the Minister for School Education Early Childhood and Youth Will the minister inform the House about the future prospects of  s schools What challenges do our schools face and how is the government addressing these Member for Bendigo thank you for being so honest There has to be someone with chivalry in this place Honourable members interjecting 8212 The member for Cook has the call It is an important issue I dare say and he Mr President I ask a  I refer the minister to the fact that during the recent keel laying ceremony of the air warfare destroyer the Labor government announced further cuts to Defence spending under the guise of smoothing On the contrary s to be progressed in 2012 13 include the replacement of Caribou transport aircraft the approval of the Growler airborne electronic attack capability which only we and the United States will have that is how advanced it Mr President my point of order goes to relevance I asked the minister to confirm that a Collins class boat is currently out of the water with no funding to actually complete the work not about the air warfare destroyer The minister has 24 seconds I draw the minister s attention to  Mr President I ask a further  Can the minister confirm that a Collins class submarine is out of the water in South  at the moment with work not able to be conducted for months to come due We are proud that  is constructing three air warfare destroyers 8212 based on a proven design from the Spanish navy When complete the destroyers will be amongst the world s most capable warships The air warfare destroyer  has All I would say about the Collins class submarines 8212 Senator Abetz interjecting 8212 Mr President I will seek advice on whether a Collins class submarine is out of the water Let me put  in context The government My question is to the Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery Senator Ludwig Can the minister provide an update to the Senate on the Gillard government s investment and action to assist Queensland to rebuild after the 2010 11 flood I thank Senator Furner for his continued interest in repairing and rebuilding Queensland after those devastating floods One hundred per cent of the state was declared a disaster area All can remember the terrible loss suffered at Grantham where devastating I rise on a point of order in terms of specific relevance I asked whether he had considered this specific case Has he considered this specific case and if not why not If so what was the outcome The minister has the call and will refer to  before the chair I conduct myself in relation to the character test in accordance with my responsibilities under the act To do otherwise would be to open the Commonwealth to potential overturning of the decision and a potential very serious compensation case as The member for Cook is warned My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship I refer the minister to his previous answer and ask has the minister considered the specific case of Taji Mustafa s visa with respect to his compliance with the public I thank the honourable member for his question Such is his interest in this matter that he wrote to me on Thursday and funnily enough he also released details to the journalists in the press gallery at a very similar Mr President I ask a  As a Queensland senator I know many people were affected by the flooding and the cyclone particularly Imogen and Alyssa in Townsville Can the minister inform the Senate how important it is to Opposition Senators Opposition senators interjecting 8212 My question is to the Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for

contribution the not for profit and charity sector make in all our communities around the country making the fabric of society so strong I rise also to speak on the n Charities and Not for profits Commission Bill 2012 and the n Charities and Not for profits Commission Consequential and Transitional Bill 2012 Everyone in this House  shares the view that I rise today to speak on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Declared Commercial Fishing Activities Bill 2012 and I will talk largely about trust What this government has done in bringing this bill to this chamber is it I rise to make a few comments about the n Charities and Not for profits Commission Bill 2012 and the n Charities and Not for profits Commission Consequential and Transitional Bill 2012 on behalf of the Greens on the basis I certainly welcome the opportunity to speak today on this package of  relating to the establishment of the n Charities and Not for profits Commission the ACNC Frankly there are a number of elements within these  that concern Order I ask you to please refer to the correct title of the minister please Minister Burke if that is the correct title is saying If you don t know everything do nothing Minister Burke was not trying in my opinion to find a way to make this venture work He had been looking I I rise to speak on the of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Declared Commercial Fishing Activities Bill 2012 I am very concerned about the sovereign risk implications for  of the conditions put on this matter by the The n Charities and Not for profits Commission Bill 2012 is a throwback to the lazy philosophy of Labor and the misguided principles of centralisation Centralised policy is slow ineffective and expensive Liberals believe in establishing a minimal charity commission I do have to take the interjection from Senator Whish Wilson who said leadership I think it is probably unruly to laugh uproariously in the chamber at an interjection but it is so completely ludicrous we have to get it It is leadership I am coming to that Senator Boswell I was just pointing out that there has been a little bit of change Certainly we have seen state Labor in New South Wales indicating that they would prefer the Greens not to I rise to make some comments on the  before us the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Declared Commercial Fishing Activities Bill 2012 It comes as no surprise that people across this country might think Just when you thought The Greens wanted this and they got it Currently the n tax office is responsible for the regulation of charities and for determining an entity s charitable status as well as having the responsibility for enforcing the taxation law Labor has decided to create an independent national regulator I rise to speak on the n Charities and Not for profits Commission Bill 2012 and the n Charities and Not for profits Commission Consequential and Transitional Bill 2012 The most feared statement in regional and rural  is We I rise as others have this morning to make a contribution to the debate on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Declared Commercial Fishing Activities Bill 2012 I have to say that it has been a very positive debate I also rise to oppose the n Charities and Not for profits Commission Bill 2012 and the related bill In following the member for Grey I can say that I share his frustration along with the frustration of many people I rise to speak on the n Charities and Not for profits Commission Bill 2012 and the n Charities and Not for profits Commission Consequential and Transitional Bill 2012 These  provide for the establishment of a new independent statutory Order  is that the amendment moved by Senator Colbeck be agreed to  is that be now read a second time Bill read a second time I m sorry The ACTING  Thanks Senator Mr Burke the minister has form on this He dumped the conditional approval on the South of Embley bauxite mine He dumped a very important  on the back of a Order Would you please refer to the minister as the minister Mr Burke And the rec fishers too which brings me to the Friday of going through went up and all of a sudden there were complaints from the rec fishers They wanted to be excluded and so an And the rec fishers I have learned a lot about the supertrawler and the Tasmanian small pelagic fishery sitting here listening to Senator Scullion who was a master mariner and fishermen and has I think served as the world fishing president for a number I rise to speak to the n Charities and Not for profits Commission Bill 2012 and the n Charities and Not for profits Commission Consequential and Transitional Bill 2012 My electorate is home to people with a great sense of My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship I remind the minister that in 2005 British citizen and radical preacher Abdur Raheem Green was prevented from visiting  by the Howard government to speak at a conference at The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will  her seat The minister has the call    goes to precedents and how these matters should be handled I am going to give credit to the member for Menzies because he too has had to consider some of these matters When he was Order The minister will return to  before the chair The Deputy Leader of the Opposition went to the very strong approach taken by the Howard government in relation to this On 29 January 2007 somebody very eloquently put the case as to why people who are guest speakers of   I rise on a point of order on relevance The minister was asked why Taji Mustafa has not been placed on the Movement Alert List  about the Howard government related to another issue I sincerely thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for her question It goes to the activities and steps taken by the Howard government in relation to Hizb ut Tahrir That was  put to me 8212 about the   I ask a  Is the minister concerned that organisations such as Hizb ut Tahrir are encouraging extremist views in  s Muslim community If so why hasn t he placed Taji Mustafa on the Movement Yet again the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is either misunderstanding or deliberately misrepresenting the Migration Act of  Just because an organisation holds views that we would all disagree with and indeed find abhorrent does not mean that every My question is to the Deputy  and Treasurer Will the Treasurer outline to the House the importance of making the right choices to support jobs I thank the member for Robertson for that question When the worst global financial crisis in 80 years hit this country we had a really stark choice We could sit back and let employment jobs and small business hit the My question is to the Treasurer I refer the Treasurer to Quest apartments in Campbelltown whose highest use electricity rate has almost doubled as a direct result of the carbon tax Its manager Mark Drinkwater states A carbon tax will My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship Senator Lundy I remind the minister that last night the number of people who have arrived on unauthorised boats under the Labor government clocked in at over I see it is still coming It is not involved in that question over there Okay we get that How does that work The RBA continues 8230 with only isolated examples of suppliers attributing price increase to the carbon price This is another example of the old scare campaign that we have been seeing in this House for the past 12 months You certainly have been making it up and that has been proven You have been in here day after day week after week exaggerating prices exploiting households and businesses for your own political gain It is just part 8212 One of their favourite tactics has been to be misleading about electricity price increases and attribute the increases to the carbon price when in fact they go to other factors 8212 overinvestment in poles and wires principally by state governments Not yet It s still coming The Manager of Opposition Business will  his seat The Treasurer has the call and will refer to  I seek to table a  with the detailed charges for Quest apartments Leave not granted   I rise on a point of order How is it relevant for the Deputy  to denigrate Aussie small business men like Mark Drinkwater rather than answer  he was asked You abuse the parliament when you do that The member for Canning is abusing the parliament just now The member for Canning and everybody can refer to the statement I read from the Speaker last night in Hansard You re just making it up as you go along I table Howard commits to emissions trading scheme from the Melbourne Press Club The government is taking action recommended by a panel of experts The government has agreed in principle as the opposition well knows to implement all 22 recommendations of the expert panel  on asylum seekers This is how responsible governments Honourable Senators Honourable senators interjecting 8212 Mr President I ask a  I refer to the statement made by Minister Bowen on 23 August that Nauru will be capable of housing 500 asylum seekers by the end of September Given that the former Howard government Order This is not the time for debate Then you were blessed   The member for Sturt should talk about nothing For the convenience of the House I am going to ask the minister to withdraw But I am putting everybody on notice that the continual level of noise will not be tolerated As the opposition well knows our plans are well underway in Nauru This has been canvassed several times through the course of various debates and conversations across this chamber and we are on track for achieving the goals that the I withdraw What I know about conservative political parties is that they have a hit list of no fewer than 80 000 public sector workers across  8212 Time expired My difficulty is given the level of noise that I was finding it quite difficult to hear anything the minister was saying   I rise on a point of order I take offence at that Poor old Clive Palmer His money is not even welcome in the LNP anymore because he is anti what is happening there Then look at the public sector jobs 8212 14 000 jobs The job of political leaders in  My question is to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation Will the minister outline how the government is supporting good jobs across the country Are there alternative approaches and what would I would like to thank the member for Moreton for his question because he like everyone on this side of the House is committed to being a pro jobs government Yes we are a government with a plan for jobs Again I think that question just underlines the pathetic politics that are being played with this issue by the opposition We are putting in place a solution as recommended by the expert panel and we will continue to do so Mr President I ask a further  I also refer the minister to comments made by Minister Bowen on 28 August in relation to offshore processing that 8230 it s not having an effect yet but it does take As to the 22 recommendations all of which we have accepted both in principle and in practice we are now in the process of implementing them If the opposition cannot bear to see the government actually taking the higher moral It is interesting to note as the opposition attempt to interject across the chamber their failure to follow through with their support for the expert panel agreements Opposition senators interjecting 8212 Order If you wish to debate  the time is after  Opposition Senators Opposition senators interjecting 8212 Order Unlike Senator Abetz we do not think 14 000 job losses in Queensland is a laughing matter I welcome the release today by Minister Shorten and Minister Ellis of a package that will provide help for Queensland workers sacked by My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations Senator Wong What is the government doing to support Queenslanders who have lost their jobs following the decision of that state government to cut 14 000 The Manager of Opposition Business will  his seat The minister has the call and  is in order I have a  I asked the minister about good jobs Minister what is the government doing to ensure these good jobs have fair pay and conditions in my local community and others around the country Opposition Members Opposition members interjecting 8212   I rise on a point of order What on earth is that question about And what is the difference between a good job and a bad job The member for Moreton has asked what Labor is doing to ensure good jobs Ms Julie Bishop interjecting 8212 The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is warned You are speaking at a very audible level and it is 8212 So it s all right for the blokes to talk at an audible level 8212 I am objecting to everybody speaking at a large level under 65 b The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will  her seat She has been advised to discontinue her very audible chatter across the table I thank the member for Moreton for his question He knows better than many people here about what makes a good job because he is married to a shift worker For the education of the Leader of Opposition Business I The member for Higgins is warned A good job is one where you are free from the tyranny of Work Choices It is ironic that whenever there is talk about industrial relations half of those people opposite want to go back to the bad old days Mr President I ask a  Can the minister advise why it was necessary for the government to provide the assistance package announced today for Queensland workers and was there an alternative approach that the government could have taken The reason the government had to act was due to the cuts made to jobs and to services by the Newman government The alternative approach that was open to the Newman government was to make responsible savings and also perhaps My question is to the Treasurer I refer the Treasurer to this power bill from Warren Stanlake who owns the Main Beach newsagency This bill clearly shows that the carbon tax has directly increased his off peak electricity charges by I will be very brief because I have dealt with this question on a number of occasions in the last couple of weeks Those opposite continue to stand up and claim electricity price increases due to the carbon price which   I rise on a point of order It was a simple question I asked the Treasurer to be directly relevant and not to start talking about Labor s philosophical troubles but to deal with what this small The member for Moncrieff will  his seat The Treasurer has the call These are the facts The coalition plan would cost households 1 300 and they come in here and talk about the cost of living The coalition plan will cost households 1 300 8212 that is a fact and it is Mr President I ask a further  What support if any has the minister seen for the government s announcement of immediate support for Queensland workers and how does this compare to support for the decision of the Queensland Honourable Senators Honourable senators interjecting 8212   given the Treasurer s insistence on getting the facts I seek leave to table the electricity  so that we can deal with the facts Leave not granted When we are ready on  we will proceed Honourable senators interjecting 8212 We are chewing up  with quite wrong behaviour on  You know interjections are disorderly If you wish to debate the time is Just before I call the Treasurer it is probably a good time to welcome all the scientists who are with us today as part of the 13th annual Science Meets Parliament delegation Honourable members Hear hear I present from News Limited Abbott steps in as Liberal MP 8212 Steve Ciobo 8212 backs call for return to elements of Work Choices All we have seen from the other side in the face of cuts to jobs to nurses to doctors to firefighters to roads to transport to palliative care and even to Vinnies is cheerleading 8212 cheerleading the Queensland government as Order You need to refer to people in the other place by their correct titles I am actually directly quoting Mr President but I am happy to say Mr Abbott is very understanding and He and people like Mr Hockey have been incredibly supportive when it comes to job cuts Time expired My question is to the Treasurer Science is central to our economy and prosperity and government investment in research is central to maintaining and growing  s scientific capacity However there is growing concern about the security of science funding My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency Senator Ludwig I refer the minister to his answer  when he erroneously asserted that the Gillard government was providing comparable protection to export businesses   I referred in my question to a letter from the University of Melbourne I seek leave to table the letter from Jim McCluskey the Deputy Vice Chancellor Research setting out the potential job implications in Victoria if Was the Treasurer reading from a  Yes I was Was it a confidential  Yes The member for Blair has the call The member is absolutely correct to describe the importance of scientific research to our country to our community and to our long term economic prosperity In this vein the government has acted very swiftly and over a period of time I thank Senator Cormann for his long question Last month the government did secure 8212 so I will grant him that 8212 an agreement to link  s carbon price with the European Union emissions trading system the ETS What   I ask the Treasurer to table the  from which he was reading Opposition Senators Opposition senators interjecting 8212 I know you do not like those two words they are an anathema to you because you do not want to act You do not agree with an emissions trading scheme It is the best way to reduce our emissions My question is to the Minister for Employment Participation and Minister for Early Childhood and Childcare Will the minister inform the House of the government s plan to provide on the ground support and jobs and skills expos to help I thank the member for Blair for his question I know that the member for Blair is deeply concerned about the jump in the local unemployment rate in Ipswich which he represents from 4 7 per cent in July to He does mean well Senator Carr But the linking arrangements do not change the overall access n firms have to international units n liable entities remain able to meet up to 50 per cent of their liabilities through international units He means well I thank Senator Cormann for his question I know he really does have an underlying support for the carbon price Mr President I ask a  The minister clearly did not understand  Why even after Labor s decision to link the carbon tax to the European scheme are European manufacturers of watches ships pleasure craft sporting goods Mr President I ask a further  Why does the Gillard Labor government think it is fair to force n businesses to pay five times as much carbon tax over the next three years as all of the businesses I thank Senator Cormann for his second  Those opposite want to talk down the economy and they want to talk up the scare campaign around the impact of the carbon price during this fixed period It is an My question is to the Treasurer Will the Treasurer rule out using funds from the budget to pay a multi billion dollar wage subsidy for workers in the childcare sector who are not even employees of the Commonwealth As I indicated at the beginning   I do not rule anything in or out in the lead up to a mid year statement or to a budget That was  and  was also about The member for North Sydney will  his seat The Treasurer has the call and will refer to  before the chair   I rise on a point of order The Treasurer has already ruled in and ruled out a number of features of the upcoming MYEFO I asked a very specific question will he rule out a multi billion As I was indicating before I do not rule anything in or out when it comes to budgets That is the consistent approach of this government as it was the consistent approach of the previous government I am delighted that My question is to Senator Ludwig representing the Attorney General In July this year the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions dropped the proceeds of crime case against David Hicks a week before it was due to go to trial and I thank Senator Wright for her continued interest in this Mr Hicks I am aware that the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions has discontinued the literary proceeds action against Mr David Hicks This decision was made independent of government and   I ask a  In light of the failure of the Treasurer to rule out paying workers in this way why should taxpayers pay billions of dollars a year in wage subsidies rather than the childcare Everybody on this side of the House is very enthusiastic about the early years agenda We are proud of what we have done in child care We understand how important it is that childcare workers are well paid We understand My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport representing the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency Will the minister update the House on the facts since the introduction of the carbon price on 1 July Why is I thank the member for Capricornia for her very good question Indeed the scare campaign about a carbon price has hit a brick wall since 1 July It has hit a brick wall as the reality has triumphed over the I thank Senator Wright for her continued interest One of the difficulties with  is that it is as I understand it framed in the way of an allegation There are and have been a range of allegations around Mr President I ask a  I thank the minister for his answer There is a large and growing body of evidence from inmates former prison guards and independent third parties that detainees in Guantanamo Bay experienced torture and Mr President I ask a further  Very recent s reveal that while in US custody in Guantanamo Bay David Hicks was forcibly administered drugs for nontherapeutic purposes 8212 for example mefloquine an antimalarial medication although it is known I thank Senator Wright for her question I think it did somewhat move from an allegation to an assertion of truth I am aware of media s of allegations that Mr Hicks was administered drugs against his will in Guantanamo The member for Higgins will  her seat The Treasurer has the call The Treasurer has the call   I rise on a point of order The member for Higgins is quite right There is a great sensitivity on that side of the House with every comment made and we take offence at him saying 8212 The Manager of Opposition Business will  his seat If everything was asked to be withdrawn in this House not a statement would be made It is in the discretion of the chair I have not sought the Treasurer to I am looking for silence in the chamber Those on that side of the House have sought to politicise this issue and they have done so in a way which has caused great damage Opposition members interjecting 8212   I rise on a point of order I ask the Treasurer to withdraw that offensive remark I have not asked the Treasurer to withdraw The Treasurer has the call This has done great damage because it has taken another nine months to get that done from the time that the minister for immigration made the offer to his counterpart on that side of the parliament The consequence of that I thank the member for Solomon for that question because she has got a hide to ask it If those on that side of the House had agreed with us nine months ago we could have had offshore processing up My question is to the Treasurer I remind the Treasurer that more than 5 000 people have arrived on illegal boats in less than three months while the government s budget assumes just 5 400 arrivals in 12 months With   I rise on a point of order It is okay for the handbag hit squad to have a very different standard but not for the Treasurer My question is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation Senator Wong I refer the minister to the 2012 13 budget which forecast that  s terms of trade would decline by 5 190 per cent this year and a We on this side of the House want to get outcomes in putting in place offshore processing We have done everything we possibly can over the past nine months to get that in place We were opposed every step of I will make a few points  is correct and I do congratulate him on being one of the few on that side who are actually aware that we did factor in a reduction in the terms of trade Mr President I ask a  I refer the minister again to the 2012 13 budget which forecast that  s export volumes would increase by 4 189 per cent this year and next year Data released today by I thank the member for that question For her there are definitely challenges I can identify particularly when we look at the impact of New South Wales government cuts on schools in her electorate like St John s Primary College My question is to the Minister for School Education Early Childhood and Youth Will the minister advise the House of the importance of school and skills education to our nation s future Are there any challenges to this I am not sure which piece of data  is referring to If he is talking about the BREE Resources and Energy Economics Quarterly  which was released earlier the note I have suggests that overall resources and energy As I have said a number of times in this place those opposite refuse to comply with the Charter of Budget Honesty that Peter Costello 8212 who they reckon is the world s greatest treasurer 8212 put in place If Mr President I ask a further  When will the minister come clean with the n people and reveal how many billions in lost revenue will hit the budget bottom line over the forward estimates due to declining commodity My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs Senator Bob Carr Can the minister provide an update on the n government s concerns over Iran s nuclear program My question is to the Treasurer I refer the Treasurer to his statement  that the government has made 130 billion of savings in the last five budgets Given that over half of his so called savings are in fact Mr President I ask a  Can the minister outline to the Senate  s sanctions policy towards Iran and what impact the sanctions are having A nuclear armed Iran is unacceptable and would pose a major threat to regional and global security The latest  of the International Atomic Energy Agency dated 30 August confirms Iran s continuing non compliance with its obligations The  The member for North Sydney will  his seat The Treasurer has the call The Manager of Opposition Business will  his seat The Treasurer has the call It gets better by the day The shadow Treasurer has denied that we have made 130 billion worth of savings in the budget even though it is in the budget He now wants me to release all of the detail   on a point of order I ask the Treasurer to table the list of his so called 130 billion in savings Stop making it up Thank you   Each year under the Charter of Budget Honesty we produce both a budget and a mid year update which contain a consolidation of all of the decisions which have been taken by the government Of Well if I had the budget papers here I would table them I am happy to table them any time But I think what this demonstrates is how sensitive those opposite are about the fact that they have a 70 The member for Mackellar will  her seat The Treasurer has the call   I rise on a point of order I refer you to page 566 of the new Practice where it states quite simply that if the minister is unable to provide an immediate substantive answer 8212 that is   8212 Order The Treasurer will  his seat The member for North Sydney has already taken his point of order on relevance The member for North Sydney will  his seat The Treasurer has the call and will refer to the Most certainly 8212 I am dealing with savings and I am dealing with budget bottom lines Of course he was then contradicted by the shadow finance spokesman who said that talk about this is fictional on 16 March 2012 Well Order The Treasurer will not use props So it is true Order The Treasurer will  his seat The Manager of Opposition Business on an issue other than relevance Well I am defying your ruling   where you asked him to be relevant and if he could not be relevant to conclude his answer Since he will not produce the list he should sit down The shadow Treasurer was correct to say that over five budgets we have made 130 billion worth of savings and of course we hope to make savings in the future For example the health minister is trying to get rid 8212 Mr President on 22 August I announced  s implementation of new sanctions against Iran They prohibit trade and investment in the country s oil gas and petrochemical sectors prohibit cooperation with Iranian financial institutions and prohibit trade with I can t hear you If you re going to interject you will have to do better than the warbling indistinct commentary you provide On 23 October 2011 the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief described the Opposition Senators Opposition senators interjecting 8212  condemns the hateful comments made by the Iranian regime against Israel and the Jewish people We are gravely concerned by Iran s human rights record According to Amnesty International there were at least 360 executions in Iran 8212 Mr President I ask a further  Can the minister update the Senate on steps that  is taking to promote and protect human rights including minority rights in Iran There is My question is to the Minister for Community Services Minister for Indigenous Employment and Economic Development and Minister for the Status of Women What type of emergency relief and support is the government providing vulnerable ns How important is it Order There is not I have listened closely to  I believe  is in order The minister can answer that part of  which does refer to her portfolio in the representational capacity that she has Mr President I rise on a point of order I think  is asking  of Senator Wong about a letter she wrote not in her capacity representing the minister for employment He sought to ask her a My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment Participation Senator Wong I ask the minister does she recall her letter to Mr Marcus L Estrange on 8 March 2007 where she argued that the official unemployment figures There is  of order I thank the member for Petrie for her very important question I know the she understands the really important role that emergency relief provides in her electorate and right across the country That is why this government has almost doubled I am of course as always flattered by  s interest in me and everything I have said through the years but what I was trying to explain to him 8212 Senator Brandis interjecting 8212 I am not sure Order Ignore the interjections Senator Wong What I was trying to explain to him is that the ABS definition of unemployment is transparent is available on their website and is as I said 8212 and I will check this 8212 the same as was in place No 8212 I understand she is representing the minister You said as the minister I have said this before I am not able to tell the minister how to answer  I believe that the minister was answering  The minister still has 42 seconds remaining to answer  I call Mr President there is  of order Senator Wong is dealing with relevant background to  very generously given the nature of  and I suggest that the opposition listen Mr President the minister specifically said she would not answer  You directed her to do so  asked whether the minister stood by a statement concerning employment statistics which she had made earlier some years ago You Mr President on a point of order Order on  The minister did answer  I cannot instruct a minister how to answer  The minister did give an answer I cannot instruct a minister and direct a minister how to answer  Mr President I rise on a point of order I asked the Minister for Employment Participation does she agree with the statement made by a Senator Wong 8212 Mr President there is no aspect of that question within the representing portfolio As the minister representing the minister Mr President I rise on a point of order I understand that you are keen to progress dealing with this matter but it is important that it be understood very clearly before us the nature of the response which has Mr President I rise on a point of order My question was does the Minister representing the Minister for Employment Participation agree with a statement by a Senator Wong about the disconnect Either the minister for employment participation representative agrees The ABS utilises definitions in relation to the official unemployment figures which have been in place for some time I can take on notice how long but my recollection is they certainly have used the same definition under both parties  has been answered but I will take your point of order Does she agree with the statement made by a Senator Wong in 2007 about the disconnect between the ABS unemployment figures and the true state of the n labour market So what I am saying to the Minister representing the Yes that is correct Given that the shadow Treasurer said he had all his policies costed 8212 although they are still hidden 8212 I call on him to table them today   on a point of order I know he has a habit of answering  s question today I ask the Treasurer to answer  will he rule out new taxes or tax increases My question is to the Treasurer I refer to the fact that the Treasurer has claimed 33 billion of savings in this year s budget Given that over half of those savings are actual tax increases or new taxes will It is not very often that you get a dorothy dixer from the other side of the House but it seems I have got one today I table all the budgets produced by this government with all the detail the My question is to the Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation How is the government delivering tax relief and new investment to strengthen the economy and help hardworking n families How does this compare with other policies to raise I thank the member for Parramatta for her question This government is determined to keep our economy strong into the future and to ensure that we are able to provide support to hardworking n families like those families in the I am not sure whether Senator Wong agrees with Senator Wong but I will try a  Does the minister agree with the Roy Morgan organisation estimate which shows that the real unemployment number in  is currently 1 There is  of order The minister still has 38 seconds remaining to answer  I have been listening to the minister s answer I believe the minister is in order Mr President I rise on a point of order going to direct relevance I did not ask about the ABS figures I said does Senator Wong as the representative minister agree with the Roy Morgan organisation figures which show that The official unemployment rate is 5 1 per cent That reflects some softening in the labour market as  may or may not know The participation rate did also shift on a seasonally adjusted basis to 65 per cent I am not quite sure what  means other than he might be a little bit obsessed with me but that is okay What I would say is this the ABS does publish statistics on the labour market and My question is to the Treasurer I refer the Treasurer to a  just put up on the n Financial Review website that states Treasurer Wayne Swan has been tackled by four Labor MPs over the government s big spending The figure that has been used by the Financial Review is wrong It has no basis in reality The only hole or crater in a budget bottom line is the 70 billion in the bottom line of those opposite He   on a point of order the Treasurer s wheels are spinning but quite frankly the GST is not what he was asked about in that question by the shadow Treasurer He should answer where is the money The Manager of Opposition Business is warned for the abuse of points of order I ask the member for Indi to withdraw Again I must admit that I could not hear what the member for Indi said but if she would like to assist the House I would ask her to withdraw If she likes she can do it from her seat I thank the member for Indi for her assistance to the House The Treasurer has the call This is what the shadow Treasurer had to say on 21 July If you are going to have a discussion about changing the GST the states have to lead the argument 8230 He is encouraging New South Wales and all Order The member for North Sydney will  his seat In the midst of all that I was actually trying to ask the Treasurer to return to   I was asked about taxation He has a lot of hide coming into the House and lecturing about taxation when he has a proposal to put up the company tax rate by 1 5 per cent 8212 that I withdraw My question is to the Minister for Tertiary Education Skills Science and Research Senator Evans Science is central to our economy and prosperity and government investment in research is central to maintaining and growing  s scientific capacity There is I thank  for  I am sure she is aware and I suppose it is why  has been asked that there are a lot of scientists in the building as part of the program by I move That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the member for North Sydney from moving the following motion forthwith That this House 1 160 160 160 notes  s comment The Leader of the House will  his seat The member for North Sydney has the call and I do not believe there is a reason to continue to shout Mr President I ask a  Minister why have you delayed your approval of funding for the industrial transformation research hubs despite the recommendation of the proposals by the n Research Council Those recommendations regarding the guidelines for applications for the Industrial Transformation Research Program are with the government It is the case that the first draft of the guidelines presented to me was rejected by me I did not think they   on a point of order is it in order for the member for North Sydney to move a suspension of standing orders 8212 House of Representatives Practice clearly outlines the circumstances of when a suspension may be Their own MPs are in rebellion about their unfunded spending In the ALP caucus room Senator Doug Cameron Tasmanian MP Geoff Lyons MP Janelle Saffin Kelvin Thomson 8212 Mr President I ask a further  Minister why has the government frozen funding for programs such as Commercialisation  and cooperative research centres which are crucial to linking scientific research with industry and business In respect of cooperative research centres which is the program that is my responsibility and in my portfolio that is just not true Senator Just because it says so in the paper does not make it true The funds have In the interests of all our hearing I move That the member be no longer heard  is that the member be no longer heard My question is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation Senator Wong I refer the minister to recent news that Myer will be closing two of its stores One is in South  specifically its store in Elizabeth a region Isn t it interesting to get  from a South n who conveniently forgets that his party in South  wants to sack a quarter of the public service For a few hours Ms Redmond actually told the truth The minister is responding The minister has 56 seconds There is  of order This side of the chamber is always concerned about jobs We have more than doubled annual infrastructure spend per head per South n We are committed unlike those opposite to building 12 future submarines to be assembled in Adelaide the Mr President I raise a point of order The minister is required to be directly relevant to  asked  asked what responsibility the government accepted for the high rate of unemployment in Adelaide and in particular in Mr President on the point of order once again Senator Brandis is reframing   was far broader than that and Senator Wong is responding in a general way Mr President I ask a  I remind the minister that the Myer store closure is symbolic of the wider problems in the retail sector in South  where retail sales increased by less than 0 67 per cent The minister is answering  The minister has 19 seconds remaining Mr President on a point of order I submit to you that an answer which abuses Senator Edwards and abuses the opposition is not responsive to  What is your government doing about retail jobs in South  That Senator Wong  your seat Senator Brandis is on his feet This government is investing in South  Those opposite want to take that investment out This government seeks to support jobs and seeks to ensure that the economic settings enable jobs to be created Eight hundred thousand jobs have been Well if you took 1 billion out of the South n economy I suspect that might have an effect on retail If you sacked one quarter of the state s public servants I suspect that might have an effect on Mr President I ask a further  With the government s 10 10 per week carbon tax compensation failing to keep retail spending strong after being weakened by the carbon tax hit is the pursuing any initiatives The answer to  is 800 000 jobs have been created since we came to government we have an economy growing at three per cent per year over the last year we have an economy 11 per cent larger I move That the Senate take note of answers given by Senator Lundy to  asked by Senator Cash We get to another day where those opposite would have some sort of celebration The number is a big number 8212 Drown a few Absolutely not I will take that interjection Drown a few I tell you what if they do not leave and we give a clear signal Senator Bishop saying If you don t move then you re not putting the lives Is the motion seconded I second the motion This government has a 120 billion budget black hole and it does not know where the money is coming from The Treasurer refused to answer  in parliament today about where the money is coming from It is no surprise that the coalition is still harping on this issue given its position on particular parts of its policy I think the Senate and the public should be reminded that we made several attempts to fix this I move That the member be no longer heard  is that the member be no longer heard I ask that further  be placed on the Notice Paper The time for the debate has expired I also rise to take note of answers given by Senator Lundy to s asked by Senator Cash who as has been said advised the Senate that some 25 000 boat people have arrived in  since the ALP I call Senator Bishop by leave 8212 I move That the Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Amendment Bill 2012 be referred to the Federation Chamber for further consideration Question agreed to The member for Solomon will  her seat   I seek your guidance as to why it was appropriate for the Treasurer to seek to bully and intimidate me when I was asking  about his asylum seeker budget blow out Is that appropriate behaviour Thank you Mr  and welcome back into the chair I think over the last week or so we have missed your sense of balance in the carrying out of those duties of the chair as similarly we have s are presented as listed in the schedule circulated to honourable members earlier today Full details of the s will be recorded in the Votes and Proceedings Mr Speaker has received a letter from the honourable member for Cook proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion namely The failure of the Government to implement a full suite of successful It was only a small boat that illegally entered  s waters last night but it was a very significant one indeed because it marked the 25 000th person to have illegally entered  on 427 boats under this government Mr  on a point of order the member for Cook well knows that he should use people s titles rather than their names The member for Cook will refer to members by their title I am not happy about how this government and in particular this minister have been dragged kicking and screaming to the table on offshore processing only to implement the offshore processing policy in a half hearted way Not one person I rise to respond and to take note of the robotic approach taken by Minister Lundy in answering  on asylum seekers which I have to remind the good Senator Bishop 8212 who clearly was missing in action during I move That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister representing the Attorney General Senator Ludwig to  without notice asked by Senator Wright today relating to Mr David Hicks On the weekend there were by leave 8212 At the request of the Chair of the Select Committee on Electricity Prices Senator Thistlethwaite I move That the Select Committee on Electricity Prices be authorised to hold a private meeting otherwise than in accordance

than in accordance with standing order 33 1 during the sitting of the Senate This is a debate about the implementation of the full suite of border protection policies And you cannot have a debate about the full suite of policies without referring to this  because this is it this is the full Outside this chamber 95 per cent of ns would support this motion Writing of last Saturday s protests the Green Left Weekly published this 8230 the police goaded the protesters in particular the youth and so the police are responsible At the request of the Chair of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs

the  I move That the Health Insurance Dental services Amendment Determination 2012 No 1 dated third of September 2012 made under subsection 3C 1 of the Health Insurance Act 1973 be disallowed The coalition is committed to extra investment into dental You are lying to these people who are most desperate in our country I would ask the minister to withdraw her unparliamentary language I call on the minister the withdraw that remark Let me put on the record that 8212 and this is certainly the department s and the public s view of this minister 8212 incompetence reigns supreme in this minister s office This minister may claim to sit around in This week I was again delighted to show my support for Micah Challenge Micah Challenge is a global campaign of Christians speaking out against poverty and injustice It is currently working towards achieving the Millennium Development goals established in September I am in continuation from my contribution from last night and as I indicated to the chamber last night I will be supporting the Marriage Amendment Bill No 2 2012 Today I want to talk about a group of people Thankyou I rise today to express how proud I was to attend the official opening of the new St Mina and St Marina Coptic Orthodox Church in Hallam last Saturday with my federal parliamentary colleague Alan Tudge member for Aston I would like to put on record my support for the intention of this Marriage Amendment Bill No 2 2012 I would also like to put on record my view that the Labor government knowing that this bill will be It is no secret that I am a passionate supporter of the sugar industry given that my electorate is the biggest sugar growing electorate in the nation We should all be passionate supporters of the sugar industry in this place I have spoken many times in this place previously about the Tasmanian health system I particularly want to talk about it again today because just last week Ms Plibersek the Minister for Health announced that they had reached an agreement Tanya Plibersek Minister for Health ripped 1 billion from Medicare for dental 8212 a proud achievement It is an extraordinary day a Labor Party minister a minister from the party of Neal Blewett and Bob Hawke has been the first I second the motion I am very pleased to speak on this motion that is seeking to retain the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme on Medicare The Chronic Disease Dental Scheme was introduced by the Leader of the Opposition when he I withdraw I ask that the member for Dickson withdraw that comment Order The minister has the call Anyway here we have exhibit A 8212 You did not say that She did not say that Order The member for Dickson I said there is a difference between asthma and cancer What did you say The member for Dickson claims that I said they are not sick That is absolutely not true Asthma is a chronic disease Minister for your information Dear oh dear A few weeks back I had the pleasure of attending the official opening of the Warburton CFA station which has a very rich history It was great to see all the volunteers who work so hard for the Warburton community Obviously I have hit a raw nerve He is a Liberal senator He wears your colours and he has got up in the chamber and made an extreme comment This has now become an international affair I would like to Opposition Senators Opposition senators interjecting 8212 The Public Service is once again under attack by the Liberals The Liberals are proudly talking up the slashing of 20 000 Public Service positions in the APS This contrasts with Labor s approach which is to find savings through I rise to support the Marriage Amendment Bill No 2 2012 and I would like to congratulate members of my party especially Senator Hanson Young for her leadership on this issue over a number of years and bringing this bill I rise to encourage all members in this place to support World Tourism Day on 27 September This is an industry that employs one million people throughout the tourism and hospitality sector 27 September coincides with the next publication of Good morning colleagues It gives me great pleasure as a parliamentary secretary with special responsibility for dairy to mention two dairy enterprises in my region which Mr  you will be pleased about in relation to growth Tasmania s I rise to speak about the tremendous work being done in my electorate by the Beaudesert Rotary Club Recently I attended the club s weekly meeting as a guest speaker and shared my experience of a recent trip aboard HMAS It s not true mate One of your staff did ring back 8212 Mr Dutton interjecting 8212 Order This is not a conversation between the member for Dickson and the member for New England the member for New England has the call I am disappointed about the member for Dickson s rather vitriolic attack both on me and on my office but I say again to the member for Dickson if there is some sort of compromise arrangement I would have thought The member for Dickson s contribution was almost an encouragement to vote against his disallowance motion which leads me to think that the motive for this is to maintain this as an issue rather than solve it I have been Order The member for New England needs to address his remarks through the chair You know that is not right I have always had great respect for you You also know as has occurred on previous occasions that my door has always been open to you 8212 always 8212 if in fact you have Order The member for Dickson has had his opportunity and will sit there in silence I would like to make a contribution to this I did not interrupt the  when he was on his rather excited diatribe but I appreciate the member for Boothby s calmer approach to this issue Maybe there are What about the  Hang on a bit You will hear a bit about the  in a minute It brings into question what the motives are of the  in coming in to this place carrying on the way he has That is not right You know that Peter Exactly right I have logs of all the attempted contacts Tony Order In accordance with standing order 193 the time for constituency statements has concluded Last Friday I had the opportunity to attend a special event where friends family and teachers past and present gathered at the Blacktown Workers Club to celebrate a special event that took place in 1962 8212 the first time the Order I call the newly appointed shadow parliamentary secretary and member for Mayo on this statement on indulgence on the London Olympics We are a nation of sports fans We can see it at the local level and we can see where sport divides us but at state and national level sport unites us Naturally ns revel in the opportunity every four He resides in Adelaide in South  I am sure that the member for Mayo will join with me and extend our condolences to the parents and the families of John McCarthy whose funeral is today in Melbourne To John Honourable Members Honourable members interjecting 8212 The member for Bowman persists in interjecting and he is warned The member for Hindmarsh will be heard in silence Because you re ripping a billion dollars out There are still people waiting on the list to get their teeth fixed There are people who cannot afford private health insurance who perhaps do not have a chronic illness but have worked all their lives paid their taxes all Order The member for Bowman will sit in silence Half as many   I sat here from nine o clock in silence I did not intervene or interject at all and I expect the same while I am speaking I am sure that the members opposite have a keen interest Order The member for Boothby has had his opportunity Can I say at the outset how delighted I am that we are actually debating dental care I say that because this is a very important issue for pensioners for children and for people on low incomes who have been We heard the  for health say earlier that in the last decade we have seen state governments drive down dental care That is because the coalition cut the Commonwealth dental scheme and waiting lists went up to 750 That s a lie   I ask that the member withdraw that remark I withdraw Thank you As I said it was a scheme that was poorly designed and that led to waste and dissatisfaction I have seen many constituents who accessed the service only to find out that the money was gone within a couple of I begin by saying I certainly believe this is a debate about national leadership I very much believe that The debate about same sex marriage is about the function and purpose of the law in relation to marriage It is Mr  thank you for those warm congratulations It means a lot coming from such a long serving and respected member of this place It is great to follow my good friend the member for Swan in talking about Thank you very much I would also like to add my congratulations to the member for Mayo s recent elevation and wish him well in his future role I would also like to congratulate the Member for Chifley 8212 congratulations I want to start by addressing the very unfortunate comments of Senator Whish Wilson in this debate where he attempted to attribute the comments the other night of Senator Bernardi to the Liberal Party as a whole I would have The member for Paterson will not respond to interjections The Minister for Health does not want to hear or understand the concerns of constituents I look forward to tomorrow when the member for Newcastle the member for Hunter the member for Shortland and the member for Charlton will all Well tell her to stop interjecting  That is your role in this House   I rise on a point of order On a number of occasions you have cautioned the member for Paterson for his use of the term you which he knows is unparliamentary and contradictory to the standing orders I thank the minister and remind the member for Paterson once again that he has to refrain from using the word you They will be seen as a priority patient I appreciate the minister s concerned but we will return to the debate The member for Paterson will be heard in silence for the remainder of his time Oh rubbish They will be seen as a priority patient and be put on the back end of the 650 000 and you know it   I rise on a point of order The member for Paterson was just extremely disrespectful to you in telling you your job and I think he should apologise to you for that with the stroke of a pen says You can get on the back of the queue The member for Hindmarsh talked about an equitable approach There is urgent and high priority work which should go to those who need it The minister constantly refers to care and concern for those disadvantaged in our community but the minister in pushing this motion to abolish this scheme 8212 I support the motion by the  of health the member for Dickson that the Health Insurance Dental services Amendment Determination 2012 No 1 dated 3 September 2012 made under subsection 3C 1 of the Health Insurance Act 1973 The member has to stop referring to you He should address his remarks through the chair I am sorry in the article the minister said The MCDDS has been massively rorted with more than 1000 complaints from patients ripped off with dentures that didn t fit work charged for that was never done and cosmetic and I ask the member for Paterson not to refer to you With the stroke of a pen Many fine words have rightly been said about the London Olympic Games at the general level and in particular terms about the performance of the n team I want to focus exclusively on the Paralympians I want to do so I would like to make clear from the start that marriage between a man and a woman is a unique social institution It is in essence different from a same sex union Redefining marriage to include same sex unions is  sent 410 athletes to compete in 23 sports at the 2012 London Olympic Games held from 27 July to 12 August Our medal haul was 35 8212 seven gold 16 silver and 12 bronze 8212 below what we expected Listening to this debate you would think there is no choice to be made But in fact we have a very important choice to be made We have a choice between keeping open the rorted wasteful Chronic Disease Dental Scheme So what The member at the table interjected again So what Mr Laming interjecting 8212 The member for Bowman says it does not matter 8212 1 000 complaints do not matter In one case that was recently canvassed in the media a dentist has been ordered to repay more than 700 000 After an initial The member for Bowman is reminded that he already has a warning Out of one million treatments Medicare visited a dentist in 2009 who was not providing treatment plans and quotes to patients nor copies of treatment plans to referring general practitioners On a return visit in 2010 Medicare found the dentist had not rectified the issues You re providing nothing for two years The member interjects nothing for two years The money starts to flow from 1 January next year As soon as the states and territories sign on they will have half a billion dollars on the table Mr Hartsuyker interjecting 8212 The CDDS is flawed It is not means tested It has no restrictions on the type of work that can be performed It has been complained about at an unbelievable rate The amounts that have been overcharged are unbelievable Why The member for Cowper is warned I rise to welcome home the n Olympic and Paralympic teams and to congratulate them on their success at the 2012 London Olympics I will begin with a few words on the London Olympics Very few cities have as many About six months ago I was at a meeting and the guest speaker was speaking about the Olympic Games His opening comments resonated He said that if we use history as a tool with reference to the good and bad Equality before the law is surely a fundamental tenet of any great society 8212 a society where every citizen feels truly valued and respected where every member of our community is able to go about their day to day lives I rise to support the disallowance motion moved by the  for health and also to support the comments of the members for Boothby and Paterson For those here in the gallery today you might be confused about what This debate is not about the right to love or the right to be loved because both rights are undeniable and irrevocable The debate is about the definition of marriage under the Marriage Act I strongly believe that marriage is I rise today to speak against the Marriage Amendment Bill No 2 2012 and I do so in support of  s position in opposing any changes to the Marriage Act and to reiterate her position when she We are honouring today the achievements of the n Olympic team at the London Olympics and Paralympics I want to make note today of the achievements of some of the current and former residents of my electorate of Wentworth which I welcome the opportunity to speak on this disallowance motion because it is a very important issue for the people of my electorate It is a very important issue because it affects those people who can afford dental treatment the Before I give to call to the member for Blair I apologise to the member he was on his feet seeking the call before I will be brief in my address on the Marriage Amendment Bill No 2 2012 I realise that this is a sensitive issue We have heard all sides of the debate for a long period of time now in the I will be supporting the Marriage Amendment Bill No 2 2012 that is before the Senate I will not speak at length I think that all of us here appreciate the fact that this bill will fail I think that The member for Blair has the call I oppose the disallowance motion In our scheme 5 2 million will be covered on the CDDS 650 000 are covered That is the reality I would have more respect for those opposite if they had a strong good caring How many times have we seen those opposite defend this and talk about it in the context of the fact that it was the Leader of the Opposition s scheme when he was the health minister By their own words   on a point of order Under section 90 it is inappropriate for the member to impute any motive upon any member of the House let alone a Leader of the Opposition and I ask that you ask There was no imputation in there The London Olympic Games finished on 12 August this year Over the weeks since homecoming celebrations have been held in each of our capital cities This is my homecoming oration to them all I would like to congratulate our n I rise to make a brief contribution to this debate on the Marriage Amendment Bill No 2 2012 I would like to place on record my views on this bill and all the other  currently before the parliament seeking Speaking to Marriage Amendment Bill No 2 2012 I am opposed to it I have a deep seated belief that marriage is between a man and a woman exclusively Marriage is a specific relationship between a man and a woman I rise to speak on the Marriage Amendment Bill No 2 2012 Two of my wife s and my best friends are a gay couple who have lived in a loving caring committed relationship for over 35 years No change The member for Blair was spinning so much 8212 spinning spinning spinning 8212 that I thought he was sadly going to fall over with dizziness there for a moment But I can understand why he is spinning because he knows I rise to speak on a simple mathematical equation which depending if you believe in unlucky 13 is a shock to logic Postcode 4306 8212 four plus three plus zero plus six 8212 equals 13 and is one of the That s why he sacked him Firstly in speaking on the Marriage Amendment Bill No 2 2012 I thank those senators who have contributed in a respectful and thoughtful way to what is a complex and highly contested issue I am particularly proud that the Labor No he appointed him knowing those views These views have been articulated by Senator Bernardi on a range of subjects for many years and Mr Abbott made the decision to make him his personal representative 8212 his personal parliamentary secretary I strongly condemn the New South Wales Liberal government s decisions to cut education funding by 1 7 billion and jeopardise the future of our kids While on one hand the federal Labor government has doubled the investment in education The recent developments in Burma 8212 or Myanmar 8212 with Aung San Suu Kyi being released from 21 years of house arrest being democratically elected to the Burmese parliament and finally accepting her Nobel Peace Prize in person and also Shame It is shameful for her to do that and she is one who very much likes to preach that she is morally superior to others because she is caring and compassionate Her action today belies her portrayal of herself Care I rise to speak to this disallowance motion I think that in listening to the debate you can see quite clearly what a cruel manoeuvre the government is engaged in This disallowance motion would restore the ability of those people Last year on 19 November I attended the official opening of the AG Lavis Pavilion in the suburb of Heathmont in the electorate of Deakin that I am privileged to represent As I noted in this place on 16 February I rise to speak to the Marriage Amendment Bill No 2 2012 The time for the discussion has been somewhat limited but I wish to place on record my brief remarks given the importance of this matter I will be I have some great small businesses in my electorate owned and managed by some very passionate and hardworking people Last week I went to visit some of these people and their businesses I visited Specsavers Nextra Subway n Country Living I rise to speak on this Marriage Amendment Bill No 2 2012 has been introduced by four members of the Labor Party and is very similar to  that was introduced and voted on  in the House I rise to speak about the achievements of seven inspiring academic and teaching professionals at Monash and Deakin universities in my electorate of Chisholm who this week received the prestigious citation award from the Gillard government for their contributions to I also support the motion that Health Insurance Dental services Amendment Determination 2012 No 1 dated 3 September 2012 made under subsection 3C 1 of the Health Insurance Act 1973 be disallowed If this disallowance motion does not pass today I present  No 12 of 2012 of the Selection of  Committee Ordered that the  be adopted I seek leave to have the  incorporated in Hansard Leave granted The  read as follows 8212 SELECTION OF  I along with many of the constituents in my area rise to express my concerns about the supposed solution for Sydney s

representing the Treasurer the Minister for Finance and Deregulation Senator Wong I refer to my question  in which I asked the minister to rule out increasing taxes to pay for the 120 billion The Leader of the Opposition has raised this matter with me privately and I acknowledge that Our nation has seen a number of ns affected by terrorist events and there is nothing we can do as a government or as My question is to  Will  consider making assistance available to the previous n victims of overseas terrorism as a way to suitably mark the forthcoming 10th anniversary of the Bali bombing I again make this point We have made a commitment which has been in place for some years now that we would ensure that we were a lower taxing government than the Howard government 8212 and guess what We are Guess what We are Because we inherited 8212 Opposition senators interjecting 8212 I know the truth hurts but no amount of guffawing and bellowing will get you away from the simple fact that if you look at tax as a Opposition Senators Opposition senators interjecting 8212 Mr President I ask a  Given that by the minister s very evasive answer the minister has put increased taxes on the government s agenda can the minister tell the Senate what new or increased taxes the government Nonsense The only party in this chamber other than the n Greens that is actually publicly advocating an increase to the company tax rate is the Liberal Party Your 1 5 per cent levy 8212 sorry a levy is not a The Leader of the Opposition would  recall Howard government decisions about how it would assist victims of terrorism 8212 including 9 11 in 2001 and both of the Bali bombings I do recall that the Leader of the   I ask a  I thank  for her answer but why should the victims of future terrorism be entitled to receive up to 75 000 in assistance but not the victims of past Senator Abetz I will take that interjection He says Nonsense He should tell that to Joe Hockey who has said that publicly Time expired My question is to  Will  update the House on the work of the n Multicultural Council that the government established last year and why does mutual respect and tolerance form the foundation of n Mr President I ask a further  I will give the minister one more opportunity Will she tell the Senate where is the money coming from to fund Labor s 120 billion black hole of new spending promises  really goes to the long term structural position of the budget That it is coming from a party that has opposed changes which improve the structural position of budget is really remarkable Those opposite think that it is I do very much thank the member for Chifley for raising this question A number of us in this parliament had what was the very special privilege last night of attending a first ever n Multicultural Council lecture delivered by I had to go and do some study before I could help The record of referendums reminded me how poor the success rate in referendums has been We know that the prospects at the moment would not be good given Did he pass I thank Senator Brown for  The Labor government is committed to constitutional change to recognise the unique and special place of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people We believe that the n Constitution should recognise Aboriginal and Torres My question is to Senator Evans the Minister representing the Minister for Families Community Services and Indigenous Affairs Can the minister update the Senate on the progress towards constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people I have received a letter from the honourable member for Flinders proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion namely The adverse impact of the carbon tax and its

through you whether  could return before the end of  to provide the House with the information as to the number of rioters whose visas have been denied To the Deputy Leader of the Opposition I will have to make some inquiries about the number and in the appropriate time will provide the Deputy Leader of the Opposition with the information she seeks As the Deputy Leader of The government believes that the passage of an act of recognition would be an important step on the path towards constitutional recognition of Indigenous ns We intend to introduce an act before the end of the year It will not Mr President I ask a further  Can the minister further advise the Senate on how passage of an act of recognition will be an important step in recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people My question is to the Minister representing  Senator Evans I refer the minister to s today that BHP Billiton has confirmed that it will not proceed with the planned Red Hill coalmine near Moranbah in Queensland which My question is to the Treasurer Will the Treasurer update the House on the response of global ratings agencies to the strong fundamentals of our economy Why is it important to represent the facts about our economy accurately I thank the member for Deakin for his question because I was asked about the strength of our economy and the fact that Standard amp Poor s have reaffirmed our gold plated AAA credit rating with a stable outlook This I withdraw   8212 I withdraw I was asked about the misrepresentation of facts about the n economy The Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer did that  8212 they misrepresented the facts We have had the Leader of the Opposition do Member for Mackellar I will not go there because I think it just demeans the parliament But the Manager of Opposition Business is warned that if he abuses a point of order again he will not be joining us for Rabid The member for Indi will withdraw her seat The member for Indi has a point of order The Manager of Opposition Business will get to the point or he will be thrown out   on a point of order if the rules are to be applied fairly 8212 and I know that you find yourself in the unhappy situation of sitting in the chair and having been mistreated for many years The Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer 8212 The member for Indi will withdraw   that point of order was clearly not a real point of order just abuse from the Manager of Opposition Business And while I am here the member for Indi should withdraw the same term that she uses The Manager of Opposition Business should have learnt better from  s effort The Leader of the House has the call The Manager of Opposition Business will  his seat The Leader of the House will  his seat I had thought the member for Indi was referring to the word bullying which I think we have allowed on more than The frontbench is not assisting The member for Indi will  her seat I will not ask the Treasurer to withdraw The Treasurer has the call   if the rules are to be applied fairly the Treasurer should be required to withdraw pit bull terrier Yes   The Treasurer made a comment that I find offensive and I ask you to direct him to withdraw Government members interjecting 8212 I welcome Senator Cormann s question I am sure Senator Wong is a bit jealous that she did not get this question I absolutely reject the implications in  s question He seeks again to talk down the n   on a point of order how can it be in order for the Treasurer to stand up here and slag and bag the opposition while accusing us of bullyboy tactics It is different to the handbag hit Mr President I ask a  Given the clear warnings from the mining industry about the increasing costs of doing business in  warnings of slower growth in China and a worldwide slide in commodity prices 8212 Senator Wong I withdraw The minister Senator Wong interjecting 8212 Senator Cormann interjecting 8212 Order Senators Cormann and Wong it is disorderly to debate across the chamber The minister Order Senator Wong you will need to withdraw that That is disorderly As I indicated earlier Mr President Senator Wong was very keen to answer this question and was very keen to assist me in responding Again I reject what Senator Cormann tries to indicate The reality is the only issue the Mr President I ask a further

employment growth in the mining sector is a function of investment and growth in the sector As a profits based tax unlike royalties the Minerals Resource I am not attending this activity I think it would probably be interesting to look at how Speakers in coalition governments have used their office in similar activities and frolics I am certain that there is a long record and by leave 8212 I move That unless otherwise ordered so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the following arrangements applying for this sitting 1 during the period from 11 a m until 2 p On the motion before the House I make the same point as I made at the end of the last sitting It is the point about the backlog of private members votes I note they are not on the order I have received a message from the Senate informing the House that Senator Milne has been appointed a member of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the n Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity After the last election of which everyone knows the result the voters of Melbourne put me in the fortunate position of being able to sit down with the now  to negotiate the formation of government On behalf of I am   Burke I am talking about the cost of the dental scheme I think that is a very important point that we need to think about Time after time we have seen examples of the government Order The member for Mayo will return to before the chair I rise to speak on the Dental Benefits Amendment Bill 2012 and the disallowance motion moved by the  for health It will not surprise people to learn that I will be taking a different approach to the one I am very pleased to speak out on the Dental Benefits Amendment Bill 2012 I think this side of the House and certainly I have always been very focused on how we better provide dental care to those who need If the member for Boothby would look at maybe he would see the massive support we are providing for children in this bill and then he might actually consider and vote for it It is disappointing You closed the school clinics Good one I rise to speak on the Dental Benefits Amendment Bill 2012 The coalition do support an investment in dental health however we have real concerns about the way the government is going to administer this bill should it pass the I am sorry  So oral health has been declining since the mid 1990s as the former health minister 8212 now Leader of the Opposition 8212 would know with almost 20 000 kids under the age of 10 hospitalised Order The member will direct his comments through the chair I rise to speak on the Dental Benefits Amendment Bill 2012 which amends the Dental Benefits Act 2008 to set up the legislative framework for the Child Dental Benefits Schedule that will commence operation in January 2014 I noted with We have sat here for 15 minutes listening to the member for Moreton but he barely if at all discussed any reason as to why the government are cutting the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme which is the central focus of I withdraw that comment The member for Fraser is supporting this Mr  so that these two pensioners will no longer be able to get the type of dental care which they so desperately need Kevin McMurrugh of Ferntree Order The member for Aston is reminded of the independence of the chair He is welcome to refer to actions of the member for Fraser but will not reflect on the chair I speak in support of the Dental Benefits Amendment Bill 2012 This bill will amend the Dental Benefits Act of 2008 by setting up the legislative framework for the Child Dental Benefits Schedule to start in January 2014 and it It is with deep regret that I inform the Senate of the death last month at the age of 97 of Charles Comans QC former First Parliamentary Counsel It was after his retirement as First Parliamentary Counsel that Charles Comans by leave 8212 I move That a the order of the Senate of 20 September 2012 authorising the Select Committee on Electricity Prices to hold a public meeting during the sitting of the Senate today be varied by omitting 8220 The coalition will be supporting the Social Security  Amendment Fair Incentives to Work Bill 2012 as it is a continuation of Welfare to Work reforms that were initiated by us in government in 2006 I go first of all I rise to speak on the government s latest unfunded policy farce 8212 the Dental Benefits Amendment Bill 2012 8212 and its astonishing political decision to axe the Howard government s Medicare Chronic Disease Dental Scheme This farce began on Senator Siewert do you have an amendment that you wish to move Schedule 1 of the Social Security  Amendment Fair Incentives to Work Bill 2012 will drive already vulnerable single parents the majority of whom are single mothers further into poverty What this bill does is drop single parents who are Yes I do I move the  amendment on sheet No 7272 At the end of the motion add but the Senate calls on the Government to bring forward additional  to provide appropriate indexation of the liquid asset Are we getting a history lesson or a debate on I rise to speak on the Dental Benefits Amendment Bill 2012 and it is good to be talking about dental care It is a particularly important thing in my electorate I have often noticed constituents who have had significant tooth He could not stop himself spending I know the member for Mayo was there at that time It must have been a glorious period announcing those sorts of schemes What we got was the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme which when I am sorry it is 252 billion 8212 that last 2 billion would certainly have gone to paying this Senator Williams So from a 70 billion surplus in 2007 we now have an estimated 147 billion debt this year 8212 I compliment both Senator Sinodinos and Senator Siewert for their contributions to this debate on the Social Security  Amendment Fair Incentives to Work Bill 2012 I think the comments that both of them have made are very telling and 252 Today I rise to speak on the Dental Benefits Amendment Bill There is an old saying which those opposite would do very well to learn and to obey If it ain t broke don t fix it For some reason For over a decade now members of the Illawarra Dental Health Action Group have been campaigning for reform in dental care The action group is chaired ably by Ms Alice Scott a constituent of mine who is a very active I have some significant concerns in relation to the Social Security  Amendment Fair Incentives to Work Bill 2012 At the outset it is important to note that the Senate Education Employment and Workplace Relations Committee  on this bill I rise today to indicate that the n Greens of course will not be supporting schedule 1 of the Social Security  Amendment Fair Incentives to Work Bill 2012 that is before us as my colleague senator Rachel Siewert has The Labor government is cutting 1 5 billion from the health budget through the Dental Benefits Amendment Bill The minister has confirmed the cuts saying that this is a direct savings measure 8212 and we know why that is necessary We can tell There will be nothing until April 2014 You can wait folks That is okay that is the Labor way We make promises we cannot deliver on and we have borrowed so much money that we cannot really borrow any more It is not true Not true Have a look at your own bill You are going to leave people in the lurch For people who are on treatment now that treatment ends at the end of November What happens to them Minister No there isn t You made that up I rise to speak on Dental Benefits Amendment Bill 2012 I guess one of the important things in communication is the ability to relate So I will relate the words of a famed communist back to Labor It was Nikita with where the government has got us It is an absolute disgrace member for Windsor The government is so desperate in pushing a budget bottom line that it is prepared to leave people in the lurch for 19 months when  is that the  amendment moved by Senator Siewert be agreed to The Social Security  Amendment Fair Incentives to Work Bill will give effect to further reforms to parenting payment and build upon the changes this parliament passed on 9 May 2012 to make the system more equitable for all recipients I welcome the opportunity to speak on this  because we do have a government that proposes to leave some of the most vulnerable ns in the lurch We do have a government that is being absolutely callous in the I inform the House that the Minister for Defence will be absent from  this week as he is attending the NATO defence ministers meeting in Brussels The Minister for Home Affairs Minister for Justice and Minister for Defence My question is to  Does  continue to have full confidence in the Speaker If not what steps will she take to remove him from the speakership I understand why the Leader of the Opposition has asked this question today What would be on his mind 8212 and he has made some public comments about this today 8212 is the publication of some text messages from Mr I seek leave to move that as provided for by section 35 of the Constitution the Speaker be removed from office immediately Leave not granted Deputy Leader of the Opposition 8212 Ms Julie Bishop interjecting 8212 Yes I know We are in new territory We are going to go back The suspension will not proceed We will go back to the original seeking of leave I second the motion Standing orders 8212  now is that be read a second time Question agreed to Bill read a second time Thank you   I move That as provided for by section 35 of the Constitution the Speaker be removed from office immediately At the risk of detaining the House in a repetitive way let me say that it My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs Senator Bob Carr I refer the minister to his public comments regarding the James Ashby allegations against the Speaker of the House of Representatives Mr Peter Slipper I remind the minister Mr President I would urge you to rule that there is  of order Despite  probably being out of order in the sense that it did not refer to the minister s ministerial responsibilities he has been You are going to have to ask Brandis why he commented on 8212 Why did you comment on Ashby before I want to inform the Senate that mediation was held with all parties last week I am advised that the government s hope with this was that this process would bring about settlement between all parties Unfortunately the mediation was There is  of order The minister has 31 seconds remaining Mr President I rise on a point of order The minister was asked two specific  does he stand by his previous public comments in this matter that he was more rehearsed than a kabuki actor 8212 Answered that 8212 answered He stands by that 8212 thank you very much And whether Mr Slipper 8212 Order When there is silence we will proceed Order Just wait a minute it is improper to debate the matter across the chamber You are quite entitled to make a point of order and if someone wishes to take another point of order based on the matter before If I may given Senator Carr s interjection I withdraw my first request because it is now on the record that Senator Carr acknowledges that he stands by his previous public comments Order That is debating the issue I therefore move to the second aspect of my point of order which was whether or not the minister believes that Mr Slipper is now an international embarrassment Therefore I stand absolutely by my comments that this matter should have gone straight to court and not been filtered through the political process The second point I would make is this 8212 and if the opposition regarded the comments Order When there is silence It is in the court The second point to make 8212 Opposition senators interjecting 8212 Opposition Senators Opposition senators interjecting 8212 The first point to make is that this matter is in the court where it belongs I refer the minister to the fact that Mr Slipper with the Serbian ambassador is tonight hosting an evening of traditional Serbian food wine and dancing in the Speaker s courtyard Is the foreign minister attending this function And if Mr President I ask a  although I would like to note that there was not one bit of relevance in the answer to that part of  Order No You need to ask  Senator I ask a  Mr President I refer to the fact that since this scandal broke Mr Slipper has officially visited Israel Lebanon Jordan and Cyprus and according to a  in the Sydney Morning Herald in the coming The minister can answer that question insomuch as it applies to the portfolio The Speaker is not subject to directions 8212 and this will be a stunning revelation to the constitutional lawyers over there 8212 from the Minister for Foreign Affairs nor I suspect from any minister This neat tweaking of constitutional niceties My question is to the Minister representing  the Minister for Tertiary Education Skills Science and Research Senator Evans Can the minister advise the Senate on how the Gillard government s management of the n economy is delivering I thank Senator Bilyk for  The n economy is the envy of much of the developed world We have an enviable combination of solid growth low unemployment contained inflation sound public finances and a large investment pipeline All This government recognises that it is not just about creating jobs and economic growth It is also about the quality of those jobs and about ensuring people are properly rewarded for the work they do That is particularly important for Mr President I have a  Following on from that can the minister advise the Senate on how the government is ensuring that social and community sector workers get their fair share from  s strong economy This announcement by  today to introduce  to enable that 2 8 billion contribution will ensure that funding goes to wage increases for the SACS workers We are looking to work with the states to make sure I have a second  Mr President Can the minister advise the Senate on how the Gillard government will work with the community sector and the states to ensure that these SACS workers get the wage rises that they My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Defence Senator Bob Carr I refer the minister to the comments he made in the Senate on 17 September 8230 by deferring Defence acquisitions and adjusting the Defence capital equipment The minister has been addressing  for 16 seconds I will listen closely to the answer of the minister At this stage there is  of order Minister you have one minute 44 remaining Mr President on the point of order that summary of  which we all found very difficult to keep up with I think is very unrealistic Given that the minister has been on his feet for about 15 seconds I repeat 8212 upgrades to Orion maritime patrol aircraft C130J aircraft and Anzac class ships I repeat that there is also a planned reduction of 1 000 civilian positions in the defence department and they will be achieved primarily through Tell us about what you were asked All this has been said before 8212 and no reductions in conditions or entitlements for service personnel The focus of the budget s capability activities will be on improving airlift land mobility submarines afloat support communications interoperability and electronic and Mr President I raise a point of order on relevance I asked specifically about training exercises for the SAS The government is proud that s to be progressed in 2012 13 adding to this country s defence capability include the replacement of Caribou transport aircraft consideration of the Growler airborne electronic attack capability the acquisition of medium and heavy Mr President I have a  I refer the minister to comments of former Army chief Professor Peter Leahy who said that he was concerned at the impact of budget cuts across a range of defence areas including special Defence s contribution to the government s fiscal strategy will have no adverse impact on the operations that should concern us all in this house without trying to extract party political advantage from them 8212 that is operations in Afghanistan It is with a heavy heart that I rise to speak on this motion for it represents a dark and ugly and shameful episode in this parliament  s choice of Speaker was the member for Fisher But Where is his evidence Where is his evidence for an adverse effect on morale He has presented no evidence for these allegations 8212 none at all Senator Johnston interjecting 8212 No let me remind you what you said You said Mr President I have a further  With highly respected commentators like the n Strategic Policy Institute describing the funding of defence as an unsustainable mess when will the government admit that its trashing of the n defence budget  has presented no evidence for any of those three propositions It s an unsustainable mess An unsustainable mess That is just a facile allegation not supported by any data It is a matter of public record that next year defence spending as a share of GDP 8212 Time expired My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations Senator Wong I refer to comments ed today by the member for Page Janelle Saffin that rather than cutting sole parent payments the government should be Just say whatever you want Thank you for that advice It is the case that the government made a decision in the 2012 13 budget in relation to a particular group of parenting payment recipients who had been grandfathered in terms of their entitlement The I missed the end of that but I think it was  about the adequacy of Newstart On the first point in relation to the discussion about the adequacy of Newstart that is on the public record and unsurprisingly Labor people who do care about fairness put their views on this issue That is reasonable and that Mr President I ask a  I thank the minister but I wanted to ask her particularly does she concede that there is widespread community support including within her own party to increase Newstart Can she explain how forcing I ask a further  Mr President I ask the minister to confirm that the government will not increase Newstart for the same reason that it is cutting the single parents payment and that is to meet its budget I make this point First a budget surplus is about a sound fiscal policy which is good for the economy Good economic management is good for jobs which is why we have seen more jobs created in the last years My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer Senator Wong I refer the minister to the latest data on  s financial accounts by the n Bureau of Statistics which shows that the total real value of financial assets In relation to  about household assets it is the case that the global financial crisis has affected asset values That is hardly news If  believes that somehow he could find a way of ensuring that asset We can rule out ever taxing the economy and the people as much as those opposite did when they were in government We know that when we came to government tax to GDP ratio was 23 7 per cent We Mr President I ask a  Can the minister rule out any further new or increased taxes on n superannuation savings to help the government pay for its 120 billion budget black hole Mr President I ask a further  Given the minister has again refused to rule out further increases in taxes on people s retirement savings what will be the impact of any additional tax increase on superannuation on top This is from  who opposes the low income super contribution They no longer oppose the increase in the Superannuation Guarantee Charge This is a government that has been a very strong supporter of superannuation We are seeking to My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs Senator Bob Carr Can the minister update the Senate on the n government s response to the humanitarian situation in Syria including the health sector in particular Mr President according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights over 170 Syrians were killed  160 were killed the day before more than 30 000 have died and 1 2 million may have been internally displaced The UN estimates Order Ministers on the front bench are not assisting Mr President I ask a  Can the minister update the Senate on the n government s response to recent s of ns joining the uprising in Syria No one walked out of the room no one walked up to Mr Jones and said that this was not acceptable Instead it was all viewed as good fun 8212 until it was run in a Sunday newspaper and then Government Members Government members interjecting 8212 I rise to oppose the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition and in so doing I say to the Leader of the Opposition I will not be lectured about sexism and misogyny by this man I will not That is a direct quote from the Leader of the Opposition so I suggest those groaning have a word with him On the conduct of Mr Slipper and on the text messages which are in the public domain 8212 I  has an embargo on military equipment and assistance to Syria This means it is illegal under n law to engage in fighting for either side and to fund to train or to recruit someone to fight or to supply You used those words It is a quote Mr President I ask a further  Can the minister please advise the Senate on what more  and the international community can do to help end the violence 8212 Until the United Nations Security Council is able to break its deadlock on Syria  will continue to work with like minded countries to increase pressure on the Assad regime We have done this through autonomous sanctions coordinated with Mr President my question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency Senator Ludwig Miss you Senator Wong After 100 days of the carbon tax and with eight major changes to the carbon tax or I thank  opposite for the opportunity to talk on the carbon price and how after 100 days the sky has not fallen in No it has not fallen in Whyalla has not been wiped off the map it Mr President I ask a  Does the minister believe the changes to the carbon tax and carbon tax programs especially the axing of the Contract for Closure program and the linking of the carbon tax to Europe will Those opposite seem to be pursuing a path of reregulation a path of stifling commercial opportunity and stifling change The EU ETS is the largest and most liquid carbon market in the world and those opposite know that The n Mr President I rise on a point of order going to relevance There was only one question that was asked and that was whether in fact the linking to Europe 8212 and the minister may be talking about the linking There is  of order The minister was addressing  I do reject the premise of  that was put forward What those opposite fail to appreciate is the EU linking 8212 Time expired There is  of order Minister you have five seconds remaining I did say and I am sure Senator Birmingham was not listening pollution will fall by 2050 Time expired Mr President I rise on a point of order going to relevance The minister has again absorbed most of the time  was specific to domestic emissions The minister has prattled on about everything else that might have been Again I reject the premise that is underlying that question If you look at the headline Treasury modelling results the government stands by those modelling results It was one of the most extensive and robust economic modelling exercises ever performed Mr President I ask a further  I will try it a different way for the new minister acting in this portfolio Will the minister confirm that under the government s own modelling even with the carbon tax  My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Sustainability Environment Water Population and Communities Senator Conroy Minister Burke has indicated that he is waiting for the national heritage council to provide a  on the possible National Heritage I thank  for his question The Gillard government is committed to a thorough environmental assessment under the EPBC Act to ensure that matters of national environmental significance in the Tarkine region are protected The assessment process under the Mr President I ask a  Considering that the current minister allowed the region s emergency heritage listing to lapse after it had been listed by the previous minister Peter Garrett what action if any does the government propose I reject utterly the premise of  There is a thorough process underway and as I said in my previous answer even if the process were successful it would not stop developments that fit within the process Minister Burke I am not sure what I can add to my earlier answer There is a thorough process being gone through and the minister is very conscious of these issues as you would probably know The minister like many of us Mr President I raise a point of order I am not disputing the thorough process Minister Conroy What I am asking is whether there will be anything left by the time the process is finished That is not a point of order I take no joy whatever in speaking on a motion of this nature I am deeply conscious of the gravity of this motion 8212 how rare it has been in the history of this parliament for a motion to remove Mr President I ask a further  Perhaps I could put it a different way Senator Conroy Wouldn t bringing forward the decision on National Heritage listing provide economic certainty for businesses invested in the area such as tourism Minister Burke is advised that the n Heritage Council has completed its assessment and will recommend that the Tarkine be inscribed on the National Heritage List The  will include a recommended boundary and place  Minister Burke does not My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship Senator Lundy I remind the minister that the 2012 13 budget forecast for the Immigration and Citizenship portfolio is based on 5 645 arrivals for the entire I am sure Senator Cash well knows that the figures will be updated in relation to the budget in MYEFO in the usual way This is the normal practice This is how it has been done for years and I We have now completed two charters of voluntary returns to Sri Lanka 8212 the first group of 18 and the second of 28 This shows the disincentive effect is working It also shows that as the facilities on Nauru are Mr President I ask a  I remind the minister that as of  there had been 101 illegal boats arrive this financial year alone carrying 6 436 asylum seekers compared to an average of just 45 people per Isn t it interesting how the opposition likes to have it all ways on this issue First of all we have members of the opposition standing up saying Why don t you implement the coalition s policy in relation to Mr President I ask a further  I remind the minister that 60 boats carrying 3 830 asylum seekers have arrived since the Labor government was dragged kicking and screaming into re establishing offshore processing on Nauru and Manus My question is to the Minister for Agriculture Fisheries and Forestry Senator Ludwig Can the minister advise the Senate on the progress of the deregulation of the wheat industry in  I thank Senator Sterle for his continued interest from the West in the deregulation of the wheat industry In answering this question let us put some facts on the table which those opposite seem to have ignored The Howard government I thank Senator Sterle for the  This morning we heard from the opposition leader about wheat deregulation recommendations by the Productivity Commission He said We support deregulation but there s got to be a managed transition He went Mr President I have a supplementary Minister are you aware of any alternative views to the Productivity Commission recommendations Opposition Senators Opposition senators interjecting 8212 You have actually joined the Greens by the sound of it You want to reregulate the industry You want to provide more costs and red tape to those exporters across the wheat industry It is quite surprising quite frankly for Who is running economic policy in the coalition Mr President I ask a further  Is the minister aware of any risks to the completion of the deregulation work started back in 2006 You do wonder You do need to come clean as to what your plans are now because if you are going to reregulate the wheat industry 8212 Time expired Mr President I ask that further  be placed on the Notice Paper I thank Senator Sterle for his second  Of course the biggest risk to deregulation is 8212 shock horror 8212 those opposite the Liberal Party They want to oppose the removal of red tape They want to oppose the I am now simply 8212 Ms Julie Bishop interjecting 8212 No I am not talking about the evidence I am just going to make clear the basis on which I am making these comments to those opposite who seek to What a shameful day this is Those opposite should be hanging their heads in shame at what they are seeking to do here 8212 plucking a piece of evidence from an ongoing case in the Federal Court of  and Opposition Members Opposition members interjecting 8212 This is the evidence This is not the evidence these are the actual contentions advanced in court last week The judge made it clear 8212 because this is one of the bases of the abuse of process application put to the court 8212 that On 21 September 2012 I took  on notice from Senator Xenophon regarding migration I now seek leave to have the answer incorporated into Hansard Leave granted The answer read as follows 8212 QUESTION TAKEN ON NOTICE TO Well that s exactly right It is amazing how one day those opposite cast aspersions that apparently the whole National Party is a doormat and then we get accused of running the show I wish they would make up their And others 8212 does that include us I move That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Agriculture Fisheries and Forestry Senator Ludwig to  without notice asked by Senators Birmingham and Sterle today relating to the carbon tax and to the I seek leave to have an answer to  from Senator McKenzie on 20 September 2012 regarding the regional structural adjustment assistance package incorporated into Hansard Leave granted The answer read as follows 8212 The Government understands that some Opposition Senators Opposition senators interjecting 8212 I see there is a bunch of schoolchildren up there God bless you but this really is appalling This is the chamber of  but sadly over the last few years Mr  the way that the conversations have Oh Oh Opposition senators interjecting 8212 Mr  I hear the collective sighs of Oh 8212 I didn t even get it out I also rise to make my contribution Before I go any further Mr  I have absolutely no idea what Senator Joyce spent the first three minutes babbling on about in relation to putting underpants on heads I have Senator Sterle I draw your attention to  before the chair Thank you Mr  As I go back I would say quite clearly that this is a bad message being sent to Western n farmers Let s get this out on the record let s make this very clear Senator Nash that is a debating point There is  of order Senator Sterle you have the call Thank you Mr  That gives me great heart because I can now quote Senator Nash saying she has great respect for Western n farmers I take it that the Nationals have now agreed to support the Labor government Mr  I rise on a point of order I would ask  to withdraw that remark He is misleading the Senate He did indeed We have very very close relationships with Western n farmers Mr  following Senator Sterle I am very pleased that you brought him back into line because what he was talking about had very little resemblance to the response from the minister which was about the carbon tax The Thank you Mr  since this Speaker has been elected 8212 he has sat in the chair for 19 days during  and not sat in the chair for 34 days during  For 34 days the current Speaker has been the Speaker with the full salary and emoluments I do not come to this debate with any sense of pleasure at all I come to this debate with a great sense of a heavy heart I have known the Speaker for the best part of 20 years and said while I am loath to do so I turn down the offer The member for Reid was good enough to be uncomfortable about the fact that he had to turn down the nomination So it was not just this I will have to call you up Chris I might have to pull you up in a minute Chris I am quite interested in Senator Cormann s interjection

the Liberal and National parties preselected Peter Slipper they did not know anything about him In  is that the motion be agreed to A letter has been received from Senator Brandis Pursuant to standing order 75 I propose that the following matter of public importance be submitted to the Senate for discussion The failure of the Attorney General the Hon Nicola Roxon MP I was not in  today because I was at the High Court representing the Leader of the Opposition at the swearing in of the 49th justice of the High Court of  Justice Gageler The swearing in was It does appear as if the MPI has been put down by the opposition for one simple reason as Senator Brandis said It does appear that that simple reason is to give an opportunity for Senator Brandis to grandstand in Order Senator Brandis you were heard in silence that I intend to depart from in this debate That does not mean that I do not have views on such matters of course I do But as I said in my time in the Senate I have tried to  Acting  on a point of order what was said at the time was by the New South Wales Police Commissioner That statement that has just been made by Senator Faulkner was incorrect Senator Faulkner should withdraw that It is not a point of order Senator Brandis I believe that what Senator Brandis did in relation to that matter was a mistake So did many other people I thought personally that a shadow Attorney General should know better But I did not come into the Senate chamber by leave 8212 I move That 1 Mr Briggs be discharged from the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties and that in his place Mrs Prentice be appointed a member of the committee and 2 Dr Stone be appointed a supplementary I ask that further  be placed on the Notice Paper I present the following Auditor General s Audit s for

impact of the Government s changes to the carbon tax on As is the case with the government s approach to many other policy areas the government s approach to putting a price on carbon or implementing a carbon tax is now in a shambles It is about time that the I was delighted to be invited to visit the Queensland Centre for Advanced Technology last week for a guided tour of CSIRO s state of the art research facilities at Pinjarra Hills I do thank Michael McWilliams Chief of Earth The position of Attorney General is as the first officer of the Commonwealth It is effectively the highest law office in  As quoted by Ross Ray QC president of the Law Council of  to the International Bar Association Last week Senator Kate Lundy and I attended the laying of the distribution fibre cable in Palmerston in my electorate of Fraser NBN Co forecast that construction should be complete in the central business district of Gungahlin and nearby suburbs This Wednesday 10 October is United Nations World

great privilege of delivering some very good news to some hardworking dedicated community workers in Ipswich Arlene Lewis Sally Spencer Jacqui Clarke Lyn Guilfoyle and Rachel Stokman work for the Ipswich Regional Advocacy Service Inc If we want to go to the integrity of the position of the Attorney General and if we want to go to the role that the Attorney General plays when it comes to matters that may or may not potentially No handing s to the police your Liberal mates in New South Wales to get involved in a case that was due to go before the courts That is the peak of hypocrisy Senator Brandis It s only a matter of debate on Lateline I rise  to provide some input into this matter of public importance as well and in my brief contribution just make two points here Firstly I think that the coalition wants to conveniently forget the facts surrounding Minister He picked up the phone to his mate the New South Wales Attorney General and said I am going to write the New South Wales Police minister a letter And not only that I have actually got s that you There are no proceedings underway I rise today to highlight an increasingly important sector in the community 8212 one that needs more attention from government 8212 the childcare sector People in this sector across Hasluck and wider  do a fantastic job Our economy would And you should talk to him often because he seems to have s about the benefit of the carbon price for Western n farmers I have said that a carbon price is the most effective way to reduce emissions And we agreed to work together towards the development of regional and global carbon markets California which those opposite deride as being subnational is in fact if looked at as a stand alone economy the world s eighth biggest economy When are we linking with that Subnational It is with pleasure that I rise to speak on this matter because the future of the n economy our prosperity fairness and equity are of the greatest importance to the Gillard government What we have heard today from the I ll be happy to talk to him Subnational 8212 and I will come to that The momentum is growing California will commence emissions trading next year on 1 January On 14 November they will have their first auction of carbon allowances By 2015 California s cap and Margaret Anne Duff made a community contribution far beyond her role as an electorate officer before her death on 25 August 2012 She was an inspiration activist and advocate for people in the south west metropolitan region of Perth in Indeed How often has this government come into this place and the other place and lectured us about the importance of protecting people in workplaces from exposure to sexual harassment How often has that been a theme hit by this There has been considerable misunderstanding even ignorance of proper process exhibited by those who have contributed to this debate from that side of the chamber and I want to touch a number of those matters First of all it is What a thing to say about sexual harassment I rise to speak in support of the Campervan and Motorhome Club of  27th National Rally 2012 which will officially open next Tuesday 16 October The rally will be held in Boonah at the Boonah Showground amp Coronation Park I rise to present a petition to the House requesting the amendment of the employment standards in the Fair Work Act to recognise the Monday and or the Tuesday following Christmas Boxing Day New Year s Day and Easter Sunday I rise to draw the public s attention to a very sad state of affairs occurring in my electorate The liquidators of a failed wine business which collapsed three years ago in June 2009 are pursuing 20 of my wine There was  of order and I look forward to you continuing to make reference to  before us I rise to express my condemnation of the New South Wales government for the cuts they have inflicted upon the New South Wales community and my community in particular with their 1 7 billion worth of cuts to school education In accordance with standing order 193 the time for members constituency statements has concluded I rise to make a contribution to this MPI debate Senator Brandis has stood here today claiming that the Attorney General has undermined public confidence in the courts and has inappropriately interfered in litigation This is a constant complaint from That is completely fallacious Your interjection was magnificently timed Senator Thank you Senator Scullion interjecting 8212  Acting  McKenzie I urge you to deal with this disorderly conduct Today we see that the shadow Attorney General does not believe that the Attorney  Acting  I raise a point of order The matter of public importance before the Senate is about the conduct of the Attorney General Ms Roxon Much as Senator Feeney might want to turn this around to make What about the Attorney General I take that interjection because the facts are well known He made phone calls to the New South Wales Attorney General and the New South Wales police minister regarding investigations The then New South Wales police minister went on to The time for the debate has now expired If I may address you on the point of order  Acting  I make the point that in these debates it is customary that the Senate allows a reasonable amount of latitude so that it can engender the Continue Senator Feeney and please ensure that your comments refer to  Thank you The Federal Police later concluded that the available evidence did not support the evidence of any criminal offences And all of this from someone who aspires to be Attorney General Can you imagine an Attorney General as reckless Only this government could do something like that I rise to speak on today s MPI because I hold great concern for the people of my electorate Macarthur and the people of  especially families pensioners and small business owners who will suffer most as a result of Magic policy The carbon tax is obviously in a mess Since the tax was introduced three months ago there have been eight major changes No wonder the people of  are so confused by this tax and fed up with I am pleased to speak on the Higher Education Support Amendment Streamlining and Other Measures Bill 2012 By the debate on in the Federation Chamber today we obviously flag that we in the coalition are not opposing the I present

contributing to climate change and that this poses great risks to our environment our economy The member for Flinders is warned I move That this bill be now read a second time This bill is part of a package of  which I referred to in the previous  speech that amend the Clean Energy Act 2011 and related acts I move That this bill be now read a second time Once again this bill is part of a package

for those two inspirational students I rise to speak about the Petrie Future Leaders Essay and Public Speaking Competition for 2012 This year marks the third round of the competition held annually in my electorate of Petrie I would like to welcome here today to That was not my question My question was who he actually consulted You do not have the information yet I understand that I was reacting perhaps to your statement that you have confidence in Minister Burke We might differ on that as you might understand I was really interested to know whether we do have any information as to Unfortunately not as yet but I do have complete confidence in Minister Burke and his decision making I move That this bill be now read a second time This is another bill which is part of the package of  that amend the Clean Energy Act 2011 and related acts At present the equivalent carbon price imposed No Clearly I would take advice from the Department of Agriculture Fisheries and Forestry in relation to the target species plus the n Fisheries Management Authority which is the independent regulatory authority and of course in respect of environment considerations Minister Thank you Minister for that My question is did you take any advice from any outside agencies for example the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation which does come under your portfolio responsibility in relation to this the Institute for Marine I rise today to speak about the generous spirit of another family in my electorate who have worked alongside local community clubs and volunteers to raise financial support for charities over many years Families in my electorate of Mitchell have I move That this bill be now read a second time This bill is another part of the package of  amending certain

that amend the Clean Energy Act 2011 and related acts facilitates the removal of the price On the total of that I will take it on notice because I do not want to mislead the Senate There were a number of advices I received so I will be safe in respect of that rather than trying Can I ask the minister to respond to  8212 acknowledging that it was amongst a number of others I asked 8212 in relation to his confidence in the science around the quota and the setting of the quota That is why I avoided it in that sense that I think it is  of fact not  of confidence I am not a scientist clearly I take advice I take advice from DAFF I take advice Minister does the advice that you have received from the department and from AFMA which is an agency that comes within your portfolio responsibility express confidence in the science around the setting of the quota for the fishery I think we are getting into a difficult area in that sense that I cannot speak for AFMA I can certainly take it on notice I have got  AFMA do a very good job and I would imagine by leave 8212 I move That in respect of the proceedings on the Clean Energy Amendment International Emissions Trading and Other Measures

worldwide there are between 130 million and 170 million people living with chronic hepatitis C In  according to the 2011 Annual Surveillance  produced by My question was specific though Does that advice to you express confidence in the quota for the fishery Surely Minister given that this whole debate is about confidence 8212 Minister Burke has said that he is uncertain particularly in relation to marine mammal interactions as part of his decision making process which is after all why we are I will take it on notice There is a range of information that has been provided to me over the time I will certainly go back and have a look Nothing stands out particularly I move That this bill be now read a second time will introduce a number of measures to strengthen and streamline the Higher Education Support Act 2003 resulting in more effective and efficient administration of the n government I think you missed the point again 8212 or perhaps not again but in this instance at least has not passed and until and unless passes I do not have a role When does Minister you would be aware that there has been some media speculation around the calculations set in the quota particularly by a Dr Wadsley from Western  Can you tell the committee whether you have any advice in response to If I recall correctly there are a range of individuals and scientists who have had views in this area in the last month I will go back and have a look at those and see whether there is any advice There are a couple of areas that I would like to explore in relation to the aspects of this bill Minister could you please explain to me how on Monday of last week you were fulsome in your defence if All of them Yes all of them So it would have got support from Mr Bandt in the other house and a couple of your left wing colleagues if  had not had the fortitude to pull them into line But I rise to update the House on a local but very important issue I have been working on in my electorate with Councillor Glenys Godfrey of Belmont The Belmont Toy Library has been operating out of its current location at I move That this bill be now read a second time The Superannuation

imposition of fees relating to approved auditors of self managed superannuation funds In recognition of the important role self managed superannuation fund auditors play Minister you must have woken up on Tuesday morning looked yourself in the face and said I was right  I took the advice of all the scientists I took the advice of these very highly qualified people I appointed A lot more easily than you would be able to So nothing happened on Monday night A challenge by Mr Rudd to Ms Gillard is nothing out of the ordinary I accept that But Minister you say nothing happened on Monday night So please tell me what it was that occurred to make you do a I was just going to say nothing and none The CHAIRMAN You have just said that so thank you Minister I rise today to highlight the important and courageous role that n nurses have played over the years in times of conflict Today I pay my respects to women who went to war risking their lives to care for soldiers Order In accordance with

Bill 2012 amends the National Health Security Act 2007 to enhance  s obligations for securing certain biological agents such as anthrax and foot Minister I would like to ask you about one specific thing I know you appear to have some amnesia over the issues around the celebrated Monday night but I am sure you will have no difficulty with this question This As I understand  we have moved to output control of the legal fisheries 8212 mind you not in all fisheries There is still the northern prawn fishery In fact I will say that you agree with me that Again I am sure you will assist with me in moving to output control for the northern prawn fishery and I have asked Mr Ian Borthwick to review the  I will wait for the results of that There has Thank you for your confirmation that the policy of the n Fisheries Management Authority is to have all our Commonwealth fisheries in output control Does this mean that given we have now moved to an input control in this regard Minister I would just like to ask about the use of the word uncertainty which is on page 7 of under Subdivision C 8212 Final Declaration It has been discussed a lot in the chamber in the last I move That this bill be now read a second time The purpose of this bill is to deal with the problem of noncitizens working without permission in  through the creation of effective laws to sanction persons who allow I support I made this view clear at the most recent n Labor Party national conference in December 2011 I expressed my view at the time that  or the state in the guise of the Commonwealth parliament All I can really add is that you should address it in the plain meaning of the word It is a matter for AFMA to make those decisions As I am advised AFMA has received a nomination fee of the Abel Tasman to fish in the small pelagic fishery In order for the Abel Tasman to be nominated I just want to go to a couple of further  that I have for Minister Ludwig Minister what is the situation with the final approvals for the vessel Can you give me another indication of what the normal time What is the normal time frame for this allocation process to occur My understanding is that there was an expectation from Seafish to be able to go fishing the Friday before last yet paperwork issues are still holding up the Minister Senator Macdonald asked  of you in respect of the ombudsman s activities in relation to what is allegedly a private investigation that is occurring around the activities within the south east MAC and the fact that Mr Clearly it is something that AFMA deals with as the independent regulator I will ask them whether they can say if there is or is not a normal period for this to occur in and take it on notice I can get an update But I always encourage people to recognise that the office of the ombudsman and the n Fisheries Management Authority are both independent bodies and act independently of one another and government I respect this independence Does the government have any concerns at all that we now have two allegations of unfair treatment by the ombudsman who you would expect the community should have some confidence will treat any inquiry fairly and give due process to One of the difficulties is that I do not accept that a lot of what you say is factual as being factual Again I will simply reiterate that if you want to question the ombudsman about their conduct you should I just want to move on to another question in relation to the act Can the minister give the committee any advice as to whether a section 33 declaration under the EPBC Act might have been considered as a part That fits under part 10 so I am not sure how it would relate to the current  if at all I do not see it being related Part 10 considerations are completely separate Again they are matters for Minister I might just take this a little bit further My understanding and my advice is that section 33 declarations are necessary to exclude individual fishing operations from the provisions of part 3 including the prohibition on taking an action that Again I think that they are two different matters Minister Burke has powers under part 10 section 33 As I understand the way that part 10 operates you can propose a strategic assessment but you do not have to make I move That this bill be now read a second time The vast majority of Commonwealth law enforcement officers are good honest hardworking people But it is an unfortunate fact that criminals target law enforcement officers Organised crime groups actively It might help if you could take that on notice I would appreciate getting an understanding of that I suppose  that comes from that is given that we have had a lot of discussion around the science the  is that Greens amendments 1 to 4 on sheet 7280 and 1 and 2 on sheet 7282 be agreed to  is that division 4 item 1 schedule 1 stand as printed Today I rise in this chamber to support marriage equality I do so because I believe it is the right thing to do It is the fair thing to do All individuals are entitled to the right to participate fully There is one final matter that I do need to deal with in relation to this because it has become part of the debate It is around the setting of the quota The Greens were quite delighted that a new I move That this bill be now read a second time This bill amends various taxation laws to implement a range of improvements to  8217 s tax laws Schedule 1 makes a small but important amendment to the definition I have listened closely to all speakers in this debate I have been challenged by and thought deeply on the many issues involved in this topic I have talked as widely as possible with the full spectrum of representatives of I would like to make a statement and get a few things on the record in relation to what Senator Colbeck just discussed There were no triumphant statements from the Greens about recent additions to the debate between Dr Wadsley I move That this bill be now read a second

talked about 8212 that is the issue of GST funding its distribution across the country Senator Bilyk and others are misleading the n community by suggesting that there is I am normally resistant to the temptation of getting involved in shallow state parochialism but there is only so much that the men and women of Western  can bear The omission this week of Dockers Captain Matthew Pavlich from I

Cabinet Ministers are shown in bold type In addition the Hon Philip Ruddock MP will act Order Senator Wong ignore the interjections There is a primary question that has been asked by Senator Abetz Address the primary question ignore the other  that might come from an aside I will take that interjection I am told I am not telling the truth The tax to GDP ratio 8212 That s not the truth As  should know if he read the budget papers the highest taxing government in  s history was in fact the government in which he was a minister the Howard government The tax to GDP 8212 My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance and Deregulation Senator Wong Will the minister rule out increasing taxes to pay for the new spending promises the government has made since the May budget The tax to GDP ratio tax as a share of the economy the sensible way to consider levels of taxation peaked at 24 8212 Opposition senators interjecting 8212 They don t like the truth it hurts 8212 peaked under which Today marks the day that the Leader of the Opposition and I return from having attended three soldiers funerals We have been engaged in a sad and sombre duty attending the funerals of Private Nathanael Galagher Lance Corporal Mervyn McDonald I think most ns understand the debt is simply deferred taxation Mr President I ask a  Does the minister agree with  s statement that every time we announce something we properly account for it and This government has implemented a range of social reforms over five years They include health care pension reform paid equity and paid parental leave and all of these have been fully funded and properly accounted for 8212 unlike those opposite Mr President I ask a further  will the minister actually answer the previous  by providing the Senate with details of how the new spending promises the government has made since the May budget will be funded We will release our MYEFO When will you release your policies We will release our MYEFO our budget update and I also refer those opposite to the comments of  when she made the Press Club speech dealing I thank Senator Crossin for this question and her for longstanding interest in education The latest OECD  confirms the clear advantage enjoyed by the well heeled in this country It is people from wealthy backgrounds who get the best My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for School Education in light of the OECD  Education at a glance 2012 which states that socioeconomic status is still strongly linked to educational attainment in  what action needs Mr President my  then based on that answer is what impact does the government expect the cuts in those states will have on students who are disadvantaged and will have on students who particularly come from the regions On behalf of the coalition 8212 and I suspect on behalf of all members of the parliament 8212 I welcome  back after her bereavement leave This is a tragic time for her and we all feel for I know that my colleagues from the National Party have been asserting that they have some interest in this matter I could remind them of their new policy platform and that is that The Nationals believe that from preschool to Mr President through you to Senator Carr as a former teacher 8212 and as I am a former teacher 8212 I am interested to know what do these cuts means for class sizes for school fees for resources in schools It is quite clear fees will rise class sizes will rise student support will fall and the education authorities have made that very very clear Let us look at Queensland There is 0 3 per cent registered for indexation in I table new ial arrangements The  read as follows 8212 COALITION SHADOW MINISTRYShadow Cabinet Ministers are shown in bold type In addition the Hon Philip Ruddock MP will act as Shadow Cabinet Secretary I inform the House that the Minister for Housing Minister for Homelessness and Minister for Small Business will be absent from  today for personal reasons The Minister for Families Community Services and Indigenous Affairs will answer  in If it is the case that the opposition objects to the member or any minister responding to interjections perhaps they should just not interject For our part we in the government will continue to implement responsible fiscal policy making the savings to fund Labor priorities in difficult environments because that is what we do We understand the importance of both good economic management and The Treasurer will return to  I was asked about savings and I have said very clearly that the government will find the savings to fund Labor priorities I am drawing the very clear contrast with the shadow Treasurer who on breakfast television admitted again this I see the Manager of Opposition Business rise on a point of order The Treasurer will return to  before the chair Order I draw to the attention of honourable senators the presence in the chamber of a parliamentary delegation from Myanmar led by the Speaker the Honourable Thura U Shwe Mann MP On behalf of all senators I wish you a The Treasurer has the call   on a point of order he is giving an entirely different answer to  that was asked I asked about his own Labor MPs asking where the money was coming from There was an interjection from over there saying Thanks to the Howard government This is the first time in our history that we have had the AAA gold plated rating from the three major rating agencies not something achieved by I am directly answering  because our AAA rating goes to the core of our fiscal discipline which has been recognised by the rating agencies 8212 indeed cited by the rating agencies for their reaffirmation of our gold plated Thanks to the Howard government I thank the shadow Treasurer for that question because we always have good conversations about good public policy in our caucus and we certainly had a good discussion  I think everybody in our caucus is absolutely proud of the My question is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation Senator Wong I refer the minister to her comments in a media release earlier this year about funding commitments when she said You 8217 d hope that before they made My question is to the Treasurer I remind the Treasurer that his own Labor MPs in Wills Page Chifley and Bass and Senator Cameron have all expressed concern about how Labor is going to pay for its 120 billion of I think that is actually the same question that Senator Abetz asked me There are also some factual assertions in  with which I do not agree but I will leave those for the moment The core issue here Sorry 8212 Mr Hockey and Mr Robb did If you do not like it maybe you should rock up to Shadow ERC and say Oh this 70 billion is a bit of a problem because it is your figure but I think it is important in the context of that question to again remind  that we did not come up with the figure of 70 billion Joe Hockey and Andrew Robb did In fact Mr Robb on national Mr President I ask a  I refer the minister to another of her recent media releases where she said 70 billion in cuts would be the equivalent of stopping Family Tax Benefit payments for three years or cutting Order You need to refer to people in the other place by their correct title   I ask a  Given the Treasurer just referred to Standard and Poor s I refer him to this advice that has just come out that says Standard and Poor s says  is heading for Honourable Members Honourable members interjecting 8212 Order It is a supplementary because it is referring to the answer given by the Treasurer Opposition Members Opposition members interjecting 8212 The Treasurer will refer to  The member for North Sydney is seeking to table a  Leader of the House is leave granted I welcome  We have just had our AAA rating reaffirmed based on the fiscal discipline that this government has shown and what we are publishing in our budgets They have confirmed that it is our strong fiscal discipline Mr President I ask a further  Given the n people could not trust  s promise before the last election that there would be no carbon tax under a government she leads why should people trust I am sure that the economic hardheads in the Liberal Party would be most pleased by Senator Cormann suggesting that Senator Cameron is the benchmark for Liberal Party fiscal transparency Senator Cameron might not regard that as a promotion he I am I seek to table the  of S amp P that says  is heading for a 20 billion deficit this year confirming the opposition s 8212 No I table Jamie

question I understand the Minister for Defence has made some public comments today on the matter but at this stage I have not seen Mr President I ask a  Given that the British did not know can we have a clarification from the minister as to whether  new before this was announced Secondly isn t the partnership between the international Afghan On a point of order   throughout that whole question on the front bench it was impossible to hear  s answer from constant interjections from those opposite It cannot be parliamentary to yell through an We have as a government across the budgets we have delivered brought our Labor values to sometimes very tough choices Mr Robb interjecting 8212 The member for Goldstein is warned We have been prepared to make changes to the budget savings in the order of 130 billion in order to fund Labor priorities We will continue to do that continue to make the right choices so that we can fund I am delighted that the Leader of the Opposition is now indicating that at the centre of the 2013 campaign will be who can best run the economy and who can best manage the federal budget If that is to The Attorney General will  her seat   I rise on a point of order I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question I particularly thank him for referring to statements that I made earlier this year because I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that at the start of this year  has the call The member for Mackellar will  her seat As with previous speakers I will not entertain this type of discussion during  but I will refer everybody to standing order 65

point of order  is talking a lot about how delighted she is to answer  but she is not actually answering  When is she going to get Order  will  her seat  has the call and will refer to  before the chair The answer to that is clearly no I have explained to the Senate that as a result of The Innocence of Muslims video plus the recent insider attacks ISAF 8212 the commanders in the field the operational leadership 8212 have 8212 I am not sure what  Cameron in Great Britain said to his cabinet I suspect that neither is  Can I just reiterate this is an operational decision taken as a result of heightened risk It Mr President I ask a further  I note the minister says it is a temporary response David Cameron has responded in the UK to the NATO disarray by telling cabinet that he plans a full scale cabinet level My question is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation I refer the minister to the fact that many economies 8212 Government Senators Government senators interjecting 8212

recent 8212 very recent 8212 appointment as shadow parliamentary secretary assisting the Leader of the Opposition I trust that he will bring his expertise on matters fiscal to I will remind everybody that it is my call and the constant calling of that is not assisting the dignity of this parliament I am asked about budgeting and how you make sure that you are making the right choices to return the budget to surplus I am indicating that as a government we are determined to make the right choices We are I think today the opposition is proving it can bellow but it cannot budget What we are going to hear from the opposition is lots of bellowing but what they will not do during any point of this  Order  will withdraw   I ask a  With 120 billion of unfunded spending commitments with revenues falling and now with a damning Standard amp Poor s  does  still claim that the government is on track The member for Moreton is warned I withdraw The Leader of the Opposition has a double standard and he should end that An opposition member Your time s up  has the call I am indicating to the opposition the following we are determined to bring the budget to surplus Standard amp Poor s have given us

remind the Senate that the n economy in the last national accounts grew 3 7 per cent for the year I would remind the Senate that since this government came to power Mr President I ask a further  Given that Asian centres such as Singapore are increasingly being selected by entrepreneurs and companies as a base to establish their headquarters in the Asia Pacific region rather than Sydney and Melbourne The member for Canning is warned Honourable members interjecting 8212 The Minister for Defence has the call I would have thought this was  we could hear in silence Stop ripping money out of Defence My question is to the Minister for Defence Will the minister update the House on developments in Afghanistan arising from recent International Security Assistance Force operational decisions I thank the member for Canberra for her question  relates to Afghanistan and recent ISAF operational directions As  and the Leader of the Opposition have reminded us in a different context earlier today these ISAF If  is concerned about taxes and competitiveness I look forward to him denouncing the royalty increase from Premier Newman which as has been outlined very clearly by the Queensland Resources Council and other mining companies will cost jobs My question is to  Conroy Can the minister advise the Senate on recent developments with the National Broadband Network and how they benefit regional  I thank Senator Furner for his question and for his interest in regional  unlike those opposite Today on the Gold Coast the NBN Co has opened its new NBN National Contact Centre Senators know that the NBN Co is Mr President I ask a  Can the minister advise the Senate on other recent developments in the development of the NBN My question is to the Treasurer I refer the Treasurer to comments by Deloitte Access Economics director Chris Richardson in relation to the government s 120 billion black hole Our budget doesn t add up anymore Will the Treasurer guarantee  we announced another 16 600 homes and businesses in Northern Queensland will be able to access the NBN in about 12 months time New NBN fibre construction maps for Cairns Mackay and Townsville have been released covering 12 suburbs Order Senator Conroy is entitled to be heard in silence Across Queensland we are on track to have construction for fibre services commenced or completed for 429 000 homes and businesses by mid 2015 And what did the local business in Cairns say Local Cairns businessman Victor de Silva told Honourable Senators Honourable senators interjecting 8212   I rise on a point of order  was about the raiding of the Future Fund He has not mentioned the Future Fund in his answer It is all irrelevant The Treasurer will no longer use props As I said I think in the House  8212 and I will say it again today 8212 as we go through the preparation of the mid year update we will find the savings that are required to make sure The Leader of the Nationals will  his seat The Treasurer has the call   8212 The Leader of the Nationals will  his seat Props are not tolerated The Treasurer should return to  before the chair There was a repeat performance this morning on breakfast television There is a 70 billion crater So they can huff and they can puff but they are not going to blow their crater away So as we go through the preparation of MYEFO we will do the normal thing that we always do which is to find savings We will do that in a responsible way That will contrast I think quite markedly with The Treasurer will return to  before the chair I thank the  for his question because I made the point before that we will go about in the preparation of our mid year update 8212 as we do through the normal budget process 8212 putting in place What about the Future Fund Mr President I ask a further  Can the minister provide advice on other recent developments in the development of the NBN in other states I was very pleased recently to be in regional Western  to launch the first NBN fixed wireless services in Geraldton This means cheaper prices for better broadband The Wyatt family were the first customers in Western  to be My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Defence Senator Evans I refer the minister to the resignation of the Secretary for Defence former Major General Duncan Lewis a very respected and esteemed defence secretary Does not his I have to congratulate the member for Kennedy 8212 in time My question is to the Treasurer Is the Treasurer aware that there is no safe anchorage on the entire Sunshine Coast from Townsville to Cairns With the Queensland government s decision to close yet another service vital to the north I know Senator Johnston has been away in Perth the last couple of days attending the funerals of two of the soldiers killed in Afghanistan I am sure it has been a trying time for him and I know a I thank the member for Kennedy for that question I have to say I thought it was some sort of sick joke when I read in the Queensland budget papers that they intended to abolish the Reconstruction Authority There has Mr Lewis in his current role he has also been a very senior officer in defence The fact is he has accepted an ambassadorial position with the government and is succeeding Dr Nelson the former Liberal leader in the role Major General Mr President I ask a  I draw the minister s attention to the fact that this year the share of GDP for defence spending will fall to 1 56 per cent the lowest figure in 74 years Next As  is aware any budget decisions taken in relation to defence have been made with the clear policy intent that there will be no impact on operational activity or front line defence operations 8212 no impact at all My question is to the Minister for School Education Early Childhood and Youth How have recent school funding announcements by the federal and state governments been received by the community What would be the impact of these funding decisions on I inform the House that we have present in the gallery  members of a parliamentary delegation from Myanmar led by the Speaker the Honourable Thura U Shwe Mann 8212 which I pronounced very badly I apologise On behalf Mr President I ask a further  With the alarm bells ringing right across defence will the government stop trashing the defence budget just to fill its 120 billion budget black hole A simple yes or no will suffice I absolutely reject the assertion in the  that the defence budget has been trashed it has not We have budgeted for over 100 billion for defence across the forward estimates It is the case that compared to like I thank the member for Robertson for her question As  said we met here today with members from the non government schools sector of New South Wales and with caucus members from New South Wales as well My question is to the Minister for Agriculture Fisheries and Forestry Senator Ludwig In the only visible alteration made by the Department of Agriculture Fisheries and Forestry to its 2009 import risk analysis the department updated the scientific name of I thank Senator Madigan for his ongoing interest in potatoes I am advised that the draft review has taken into account the publication referred to by Senator Madigan It is not correct to say that the issues raised are not I seek leave to make a personal explanation The member for Sturt will withdraw He knows he has other forms of the House in which he can air his grievance he might like to try and explain why it is in the member for Robertson s electorate and in his own electorate as well that every bit of significant additional investment that has gone into the schools has come from Order The member for Sturt is warned  was in order The minister has the call   I rise on a point of order There seems to be some sloppiness creeping into the government s s How can the minister be asked  about state government responsibilities which are not within his I thank the member for Robertson for her question   I ask a  to the Minister for School Education Early Childhood and Youth How will this situation particularly affect schools in my electorate the seat of Robertson in New South Wales The member for Robertson takes a very keen interest in the schools in her electorate In the Diocese of Broken Bay impact on non government schools particularly on those smaller non government schools that provide important education in her electorate Indeed the member for Sturt can make a personal explanation at his earliest convenience but I would say that perhaps it would be a bad precedent to set during  I will allow him the opportunity to do that I withdraw Mr President I have a  Minister can you advise whether DAFF believe that they have conducted a comprehensive analysis of the research when industry continues to cite new contradictory research demonstrating that the vector required for the transmission I thank Senator Madigan for his first  I understand Senator Madigan this morning attended a briefing with departmental officials I cannot speak on behalf of them but had he directly asked the officials this question I have no Mr President I have a second  Minister in light of the fact that the department s draft importation advice is that shipping containers can be aired in transit and on receiving wharves with open doors or vents can My question is to  I remind  that in the four months since the budget the number of unemployed has risen by 18 000 many companies are ing falling profits and there has been a I thank Senator Madigan for his second  I am advised that the draft condition for the import would require potatoes to be in bags and or covered on arrival as the department officials advised at the members and I thank the member for his question Firstly I would say to the member that I think it is very important that in this place we do not talk down the fundamental strength of the n economy I would remind   I rise on a point of order relevance It was quite a simple and straightforward question Does  stand by the budget forecast for the increase in revenue Yes or no The Leader of the Opposition will  his seat  has the call My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship Senator Lundy I refer the minister to her response in   to  asked by me where she stated The combination of an increased I was pointing out it was  the sole purpose of which was to create fear and concern about the n economy That is not appropriate conduct by the  for finance It is not appropriate conduct by The recommendations from the expert panel as the opposition well knows included regional processing in Nauru and PNG as soon as practicable We believe the measures we are putting in place will be effective and over time that will be Order When there is silence we will proceed If you wish to debate it the time to debate is after  Opposition Senators Opposition senators interjecting 8212 It does not matter how many times the coalition asks this question the answer will be the same The answer is that we have adopted the 22 recommendations of an expert working panel and we are in the process of My question is to the Minister for Mental Health and Ageing Minister for Social Inclusion and Minister Assisting  on Mental Health Reform How is the government supporting charities and not for profit organisations to do their job Mr President I have a  I again refer the minister to her comments in   that The combination of an increased refugee intake from offshore and no advantage for those who arrive by boat removes the I thank the member for Petrie for her question because she understands that a healthy modern democracy needs more than just a parliament and courts to protect the rights of citizens it needs also a vigorous civil society a free Mr President I rise on a point of order 8212 on relevance  was about the government s policy and specifically

Committee on Health and Ageing but I am sure he will be replaced by someone equally The government opposes the amendment put forward by the member for Melbourne because it is economically

senators interjecting 8212 because we did not plan it properly We now have an opportunity to ensure that we plan it properly But there is something else along with the capacity to budget one issue that you will all agree with If you Yes I know 8212 ask the Hansard here Senator Macdonald It was a sad day He is a great bloke but it is very difficult to defend the indefensible The other issue is of course that it is going to I am going to take that already we have interjections from the other side Someone asked me Well who put those things in place I am going to get to exactly who actually decided that marine protected areas should be I rise today to make a contribution to a very important piece of  the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Making Marine Parks

comments through the chair I have said commercial fishers and rec fishers have both been running exaggerated claims about the impact it will have They do not appreciate the value that marine protected areas play in actually keeping their fisheries sustainable Marine protection is But it gives you an idea of what the IUCN is like Who says that it stops them enjoying beaches It has recognised and paid tribute to  Actually Senator Macdonald the IUCN is a combination of government and non government organisations and if you understood IUCN you would understand 8212 Sorry through the chair Senator Macdonald probably needs to go and have a look at the way the IUCN operates as a house of both government and non government organisations Yes with people like Senator Milne Actually she is not any more Senator Macdonald The IUCN recognised the value importance and significance of the series of marine protected areas that  is about to establish We hear lots arguments around the social and economic impacts Again this is inconvenient for the coalition because it Is this the one Christine is on Maybe you should look at the science Senator Macdonald 8212 the inconvenient science 8212 that shows that you need healthy ecosystems that are resilient Just doing some pest control does not deal with the underlying causes of those pest outbreaks I have lived with crown of thorns starfish Rec fishers too It will come as no surprise I am sure to the chamber to know that the Greens will not be supporting the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Making Marine Parks Accountable Bill 2012 This bill is really a cynical Look at some of the words that people have been saying around locking up our marine environment It does mean that people can still enjoy our beaches The parks do however reduce human activities on our marine life They are Spare me spare me Again Senator Macdonald is saying Spare me He does not want to hear the facts He does not want to hear what the scientists are saying around crown of thorns starfish Simply doing a bit of pest control will not I rise today to speak about the locality of Kwinana and its recent qualification as a

doing this bioregional marine planning will Thank you  Acting  I will do that  Acting  one thing I could say about Senator Thistlethwaite s speech 8212 and this was new for the Labor Party 8212 is that he did actually acknowledge Yes certainly  Acting  through you I ask the next speaker to tell me what is offensive about that what is wrong with that Finally can I ask the next speaker to advise what is wrong with members I must say I am rather disappointed to have heard the previous speaker I have always had regard for Senator Siewert as being one of the few members of the Greens political party who is a genuine environmentalist but clearly Senator Macdonald can I again remind you to direct your comments to the other side through the chair Senator Macdonald  Acting  on a point of order

with some reservations As is As the member for Riverina and other members on the other side of the House well know wheat is one of the very last federally regulated commodities in  The Wheat Export Marketing Amendment Bill 2012 is continuing a process I am conscious Mr Acting  Edwards that you hope to speak on the Migration  Amendment Student Visas Bill 2012 but your duties to the parliament

reuse  a 10 6 million joint initiative between the and the Brisbane City Council at Downey Park Windsor It is becoming increasingly clear that this government is not only not on side with small

representing the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency Senator Ludwig The minister I am sure will be familiar with the refinery operated by Queensland Alumina Limited at Gladstone in our home state of I thank Senator Brandis for for once having a continued interest in Queensland Can I say that as with other parts 8212 No no We share a lot of common values I am sure Honourable senators interjecting 8212 Order Wait a minute Senator Ludwig The exchange needs to cease and I just need to have your answer Senator Ludwig Opposition Senators Opposition senators interjecting 8212 The government is assisting aluminium smelters but first of all let me say that in terms of employment loss in any industry it is always a very sad day when you hear of that news The government for its part Order When there is silence we will proceed Honourable Senators Honourable senators interjecting 8212 Mr President I ask a  Given that the carbon tax is forcing up both household and business electricity prices and is responsible for most of the sharp increases in electricity prices that have been suffered in recent months by leave 8212 I move That further statements on indulgence in relation to the 10th anniversary of the Bali bombings be permitted in the Federation Chamber I thank  and the Leader of the Opposition for their comments My question is to  I refer  to today s labour market data which shows that since her carbon and mining taxes were introduced the unemployment rate has risen to its highest level in 2 Here we have it again from those opposite descending into the scare campaign the miserable scare campaign that they want to run Then they use  to try to promote their mistruths about this issue What we have in  will return to  before the chair So on the unemployment data what this should cause people to reflect on is the damage Liberals do in government to the jobs of working ns Look at the Queensland figures There is the proof Let me repeat that for opposition members who were screaming instead of listening over 32 000 full time jobs were created in September There are 32 000 ns who are now in full time work For those ns that is Opposition Members Opposition members interjecting 8212 The Leader of the Opposition clearly misunderstands today s employment figures I believe it is very important that ns have the facts about these employment figures rather than hearing the Leader of the Opposition s misrepresentations Over 32 000 full Mr President I ask a further  Why is the minister oblivious to the fact that as every Queenslander knows electricity prices in our state have skyrocketed in recent months largely as a result of the carbon tax Why Opposition Senators Opposition senators interjecting 8212 You have not done your homework and you have been caught out again like a truant schoolchild The average electricity bill went up by approximately 50 per cent over the last four years We did not hear a blink from Order On  I am waiting to give the call When there is silence we will proceed Lazy opposition all they want to do is run that scare campaign again The average electricity bill 8212 It has been 10 years since the bomb struck Paddy s Bar and the Sari Club in Bali tragically claiming 202 lives including 88 ns 8212 43 from my state New South Wales At least 100 others were injured maimed My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs Senator Bob Carr Can the minister inform the Senate about the n government s memorial services for the 10th anniversary of the 2002 Bali bombings My question is to  How is  commemorating the 10th anniversary of the first Bali bombings I thank the member for her question We as a House have just had the opportunity to reflect on what these bombings meant to our nation what they meant to each of us and the way in which ns will Mr President I ask a  I thank the minister for that response Can the minister advise what the government is doing now to support survivors and families of victims to participate in the memorial services On 19 August  announced a package of assistance to survivors and the families of victims to attend services in Bali and Canberra Direct financial assistance has been offered by the n government to cover the cost of To the shadow Treasurer I refer him to today s employment figures and the creation of 32 000 jobs I refer him to the Leader of the Opposition s reckless fear campaign which the shadow Treasurer is now trying to Deserving of high praise is the response of Indonesia to terrorism Since the Bali bombing the Indonesian authorities have laid over 700 charges against people accused of terrorism and delivered convictions in over 400 cases That is 400 people in Mr President I ask a further  Can the minister also advise the Senate of the n government s efforts to work with the government of Indonesia to reduce the threat of terrorism My question is to  I refer  to her words only  Since we announced the carbon pricing scheme 73 500 jobs have been created Is  aware that this represents the slowest My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency Senator Ludwig I refer the minister to Grain Products  a Tamworth business that employs 68 people and has been crippled by the government s Honourable Senators Honourable senators interjecting 8212 I thank Senator Williams for his continued interest in at least parts of rural  One of the important parts is that I do not accept the premise of  If Senator Williams has those figures then I always Order When there is silence on  we will proceed The Treasury modelling and the recent analysis by Big Switch s on larger business users demonstrated an average price rise of around 11 per cent due to the carbon price That is why it is very important to get the My question is to the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and Will the minister update the House on the carbon price and its impact on household electricity prices Why is it important that ns hear the truth regarding Just  the opposition leader in  made a false statement a false claim about the electricity bill of an elderly Western n The opposition leader told the House With an 800 increase in just one bill of which I thank the member for Reid for his question The government has been entirely up front about the impact of the carbon price on household electricity  because the Treasury modelling found the carbon price would increase household electricity prices The member for Dawson is warned I apologise The second thing evident from the most cursory examination of this bill is that the electricity consumption almost doubled compared to the previous billing period The statements that are made by the Leader of the Opposition are totally Minister the use of the word you is inappropriate Mr President I have a  I refer the minister to the fact that without the carbon tax Grain Products  paid 18 4c a kilowatt hour and the carbon tax has added 2 1c per kilowatt hour This I thank Senator Williams again I do not accept at face value what you are saying It is very important that you provide that and that you table it It is important to make sure that we get this accurate Mr President I ask a further  With the carbon tax to go up and up under your government s estimates will you finally admit this economy wide carbon tax is an impediment to business in  and will I am pleased Senator Williams now talks about business certainty The biggest threat to business certainty is those opposite saying that they are going to withdraw it and rule out a carbon price into the future That will create the My question is to  I refer  to the cost of electricity which has risen 64 per cent since Labor came to power the cost of water and sewerage which has risen 59 per cent From the Leader of the National Party what we see is a continuation of the campaign of deceit that the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency was just exposing to this parliament 8212 a campaign of falsehoods and misrepresentations My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency Minister Ludwig Is the minister aware of the overwhelming across the board support in Port Augusta for transitioning from the two dirty coal fired power Before the clock starts today is CanTeen day Like the member for Herbert and many others I am sure we all support kids with cancer My question is to   regulators electricity market participants economists and Thank you Dorothy Mr President I ask a  to the minister I thank the minister for the first answer A recent vote showed that 99 per cent of the Port Augusta community joined their local council the current plant s employees I thank the member for his question and note that his question is trying to get to some of the real causes of price rises in electricity I am not surprised that it was objected to by the opposition because I

but if she could elaborate as to this in terms of the international trade remedies adviser through the Ai Group and I know the n Industry Group has done a lot Thanks Senator Xenophon To bring on a case I understand that there needs to be 25 per cent of the market so it is not going to be a single SME in the way that you describe There will be If I could rephrase  in another way under this  can the government elaborate whether with the 25 per cent whether there can be a grouping together in terms of what is being proposed and under the current I am pleased to speak in continuation on the

Exchange Council ninth delegation from New Zealand led by Ms Louise Upston MP On behalf of all senators I wish you a warm Opposition Members Opposition members interjecting 8212 I thank Senator Fierravanti Wells It is an area where for some time we have had bipartisan support across the chamber to improve mental health I think on a day like today which is about mental health we ought to As much as the opposition might interject and yell they cannot get away from the fact that there have been 62 per cent increases in Western  over the last 40 years and that is not about carbon pricing that I say to the Leader of the Opposition here we are back to the same old siren song of negativity and distorting the facts He says he is concerned about this pensioner in Western  I do understand that pensioners  Speaker I ask a  to  With an 800 increase in just one bill of which 70 per cent is due to the carbon tax how can  possibly claim that Hetty s Mr President I ask a  In March this year Professor Ian Hickie wrote As a result of the mess left at the end of the Rudd era key structural issues in mental health services remain unresolved There is I thank Senator Fierravanti Wells for her continuing interest in what this government describes as a roadmap for national mental health reforms from 2012 to 2022 That is how this government is responding to those comments from some quarters The  Speaker I ask the Leader of the Opposition to table that he is referring to I am happy to table it it shows an 800 increase Mr President I ask a further  In the year of so called decision and delivery how can the government which promised that mental health would be a second term priority explain the mounting chorus of criticism emanating from I say to the Leader of the Opposition that we will take a look at the  that has been provided because the routine performance of the opposition in this place has been to mislead about the content of  Can I remind the Senate that it is important to take the view that we are committing a significant amount of funding to mental health more than any other government has done and we are doing it in a way I draw to the attention of honourable senators the presence in the chamber of a parliamentary delegation from Myanmar led by the Speaker the Hon U Khin Aung Myint MP On behalf all senators I wish you a warm welcome I thank the member for

Senator Conroy Can the minister provide advice on initiatives the government is taking to ensure the n business community is addressing the opportunities and challenges arising from Opposition Senators Opposition senators interjecting 8212 I thank the good senator for his question and for his interest in the impact of the digital age on n society and our economy The digital revolution is transforming every part of the economy 8212 24 000 users and I note some of the interjections from those opposite When we talk about a cloud 8212 Time expired Mr President I ask a  Can the minister provide advice to the Senate on how the digital economy is impacting regional  As I was saying in this chamber we talk about a cloud strategy and those opposite try to look outside to see if it is raining because they do not have a clue At the forum we heard about the My question is to  I remind  of the statement of Paul Kerin South  s independent essential services regulator who said when asked if repealing the carbon tax would cut electricity prices Yes and  Speaker on a point of order  was isn t it true that if you cut the carbon tax you would cut electricity prices  is making absolutely no attempt to answer that question at all The member for Boothby well knows that the government said from the time that it announced the plan to put a price on carbon that it would have an impact on electricity prices We always said that We always said The Manager of Opposition Business will  his seat  has the call and will refer to  before the chair On electricity prices of course the opposition has been out there with false claims too They have talked about astronomical increases The opposition know that the increase around the country has been what was predicted 8212 10 per cent or Mr President I ask a further  Can the minister provide any details of economic activity in regional  that will benefit from the National Broadband Network Opposition Senators Opposition senators

11 that in the 2012 13 budget Defence contributed Order there is  of order Your question was broader than that The answer has finished Mr President on a point of order my question was not about the Papua New Guinea elections It was about Defence capability and the hollowing out of the force that this government s budget cuts have created  Speaker I ask a  to  I refer to the note from Hetty Verolme to my office To follow is the electricity account as stated I used the same equipment such as heaters washing machine I am responding to the point of order The fact that  of the Leader of the Opposition was a supplementary to the first question not to the second one we let go but the words are in a What s this  Speaker on the point of order 8212  Speaker I rise on a point of order How can it be relevant for  to mislead the parliament by claiming that the increase is nine per cent when the Leader of the Opposition asked about 70 As I have indicated before points of order on process will not be allowed during   has concluded her answer Let me be very clear to the Leader of the Opposition I am concerned about the position of this pensioner and I am concerned about the position of every n pensioner That is why I am proud to lead a Order There is  of order The minister is answering  The minister has 14 seconds remaining Mr President on a point of order the minister should know that current operations are funded by supplementary funding and  was going to capability from the budget cuts Mr President I ask my first  Given that the CDF and Secretary have now stated in writing that these budget cuts announced in May will reduce  s defence capability at a time when they highlight that regional Also 2 there will be no adverse impact on military numbers 3 there will be no adverse implication for kit for forces about to be deployed or on deployment and 4 there will be no reductions in conditions or entitlements None of the savings will impede our nation s defences We will maintain an n Defence Force able to protect our interests and help maintain the peace and stability of our region As the government has previously said most savings My question is to the Treasurer What does  s International Monetary Fund World Economic Outlook say about the global economy and  s performance I thank the member for Corangamite for his very important question The IMF s World Economic Outlook does predict a slowing down in global growth in 2012 and 2013 The recession in Europe and moderating growth in the United States Mr President I have a second  Given that the n Strategic Policy Institute has stated that the deferral of Defence funds to beyond 2012 13 has created a five year period where spending will need to grow in Defence funding is not off track The appropriation for 2012 13 is 24 2 billion In the 2009 10 budget the government for the first time budgeted over 100 billion for Defence across the forward estimates In this budget the Mr President my question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Families Community Services and Indigenous Affairs Senator Evans  this Senate passed the Social Security  Fair Incentives to Work Amendment Bill which will result in nearly 150 I thank  for her question I appreciate her ongoing interest in this issue and her concern for single parents But I just make this point the government has been very clear about this change We are actually trying  Speaker I ask a  The Treasurer spoke about the facts of our economic performance What do these mean for businesses and working people in my electorate and why is it important to stick to the facts when It is very important to acknowledge the impact of these policies when it comes to people at the local level right around  For example in  at the moment if you have a 300 000 mortgage you are paying Mr President I have a  Given that a significant proportion of the clients of these emergency services are already single parents I ask is the government going to give additional funding to emergency services to cope with the On the point of order  Speaker given that the last account had a box on it it is not unreasonable to ask the opposition if they want an accurate answer to put forward the facts On the point of order  Speaker if the Leader of the House wants to have a  tabled he can do what the opposition does 8212 ask for it at the end of answers or  Interrupting the answer Order The member for North Sydney should be careful when talking about abuse of the standing orders On a point of order  Speaker I ask that the letter from which the member for Macquarie is reading be tabled Mr Hockey interjecting 8212 The changes that come in for this cohort of parents will put them on the same conditions as a larger cohort already on those conditions They basically say that when your child turns eight you will have to be transferred  Speaker I congratulate you on your election My question is to  I refer to this electricity bill from Bernadette and Mike Thompson who live with their six year old son Alexander in Lugarno in the electorate I take it that is a no to additional money for emergency services Mr President I ask a second  Will the government be monitoring the impact of its decision to move this additional cohort of single parents onto Order The member for Mackellar is warned I am not covering up the s I seek leave to table 8212 On a point of order  Speaker the Leader of the Opposition just referred to me as a piece of work I require that to be withdrawn Is leave granted In the interests of transparency I am more than happy to seek leave to table the  I am happy to withdraw You are a piece of work I ask the Leader of the Opposition to withdraw The member asking  has not seen fit to table the s I am not sure why they are being covered up but I suspect it is because what we know to be the truth is transparent from the I am happy to take on board and on notice  of impact on emergency and relief services and ask the minister for any further advice But I would make the point that these single parents will continue to Yes but transparency would require it to be tabled before  Leave granted Opposition members interjecting 8212 Before calling the next questioner I acknowledge the presence in the gallery of former senator Lyn Allison Welcome back I hope you are enjoying  as much as the rest of us are Honourable senators Hear hear You were very young at the time 8212 very very young I think this relates to the Grocon dispute I am not quite sure if that is the case from all the rhetoric in  but I think that is right I am going to be clear as Mr Shorten Order Just address  Senator Wong Ignore the interjections That was before I worked for the Carr government 8212 that is true But enough of my biography Mr President it is not that interesting I also want to acknowledge that this is I think the second question this year That s before you worked for the Carr government I trust Ms Allison will enjoy this question My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and former CFMEU industrial officer Senator Wong Will the minister advise the Senate whether Mr John Setka of I was much younger I did not have grey hair 8212 that is how long ago it was Senator I am flattered that Senator Abetz is so interested in my work history of a couple of decades ago Mr President I ask a  We are still to find out whether he is a fit and proper person in the minister s view but will the minister confirm that the Fair Work Building Industry Inspectorate has recently I thank the member for Dobell for his question Particularly when it comes to issues of natural disasters there is a very high degree of sensitivity about trying to make sure the information offered by the Bureau of Meteorology is I will get some more advice for  if I can I understand that  is whether or not amendments to the Fair Work Building Industry  could stop the FWBC from prosecuting the CFMEU The advice I Order Order on  Silence Honourable Senators Honourable senators interjecting 8212 My question is to the Minister for Sustainability Environment Water Population and Communities Just a few days ago on the Central Coast we experienced an early onset of the fire season Once again we saw properties under threat from large I suspect some of that might be asking me for a legal opinion and I am sure that his honour from behind might be willing to pontificate about it if he were asked by his leader The advice I do The member for Higgins is warned Before I call for the next question I want to recognise students from the electorate of Gellibrand who are here in the gallery today I would not normally do this but I had to stand them up today because of My question is to the Minister for Community Services How is the government making sure that some of our lowest paid workers in the social and community services sector are treated with fairness and justice in light of Fair Work Mr President I ask a further  Does the minister acknowledge that the recent surge in militancy by her former union the CFMEU is directly linked to the Green Labor alliance decision to abolish the n Building and Construction I think this is just yet another rant from Senator Abetz about the building industry Senator Abetz interjecting 8212 I am responding to  Senator I have been in this chamber long enough including on the Work Choices debate I thank the member for Greenway for her very important question I was really pleased this morning to introduce  into this place to ensure our contribution of 2 8 billion to fund pay increases for social and community services My question is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation Senator Wong Can the minister outline to the Senate the effect of the n government protocols governing the engagement between Commonwealth bodies and the Parliamentary Budget Officer released last month The protocols to which Senator Cameron refers are government policy and what they are about is ensuring that the Parliamentary Budget Office can operate well and as the committee that the coalition was a member of anticipated that the Parliamentary My question is to  I remind  of the more than 6 000 job losses in the resources sector since the introduction of the carbon and mining taxes on 1 July including 1 500 job given the sensitivity of the Leader of the House It is a sexist remark apparently  being asked here peddles a mistruth and that ought not to be done So let us be very clear about carbon pricing Jobs have continued to grow with a carbon price Our economy is strong with a carbon But what you should not do is add to that misery and heartache through misrepresentation What you should not do is pretend to those people who are already dealing with a major lifetime event the loss of a job 8212 The member s question is misrepresentation based on misrepresentation a misrepresentation of my words and the context in which they were delivered and 8212 far far worse 8212 a misrepresentation to the n people and the people of his electorate  Speaker I raise two points of order The first point of order is that  was about people losing their jobs and  is straying far from  The second is that  The Manager of Opposition Business will  his seat 8212 Thank you Mr President Those opposite want to use catering companies rather than use the Parliamentary Budget Office because they want to hide the cost 8212 Time expired The Manager of Opposition Business will not abuse points of order at the dispatch box  has the call and will refer to  before the chair Order You need to withdraw that Senator Scullion That is not in order I withdraw Senator Wong you have four seconds remaining I thank Senator Cameron for that question No the rules of disclosure of election policy costings as laid down by Peter Costello have not changed We agree with Peter Costello when he said as he introduced the Charter of Budget Mr President I ask a  Can the minister explain to the Senate whether the establishment of the Parliamentary Budget Office has changed the existing Charter of Budget Honesty rules around disclosure of election policy costings Have the rules The member for Dickson is warned What about the carbon tax You hypocrite is peddle a mistruth to them Like Kevin Like Kevin I described the member s question as misrepresentation based on misrepresentation with the biggest misrepresentation in it the most important misrepresentation being the misrepresentation about n jobs Since we made the announcement about a carbon pricing scheme 73 500 jobs Mr President I ask a further  Can the minister outline to the Senate what support is available for non government members and senators following the establishment of the Parliamentary Budget Office How does this contrast with the situation No amount of interjection and no amount of bluster is going to get around that fact Time expired Opposition Senators Opposition senators interjecting 8212 This change demonstrates that the I m too lazy response from the opposition no longer works because someone else will do the work if you just give them your policies That is what you want to do anyway you want My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer Senator Wong Can the minister confirm s in the n Financial Review today said to be based on advice from government sources that the Gillard government has delayed but not shelved My question is to the Will the minister outlined to the House how the government is helping n families with everyday expenses What is the history of this support and what challenges exist to it today I inform the House that we have present in the gallery  members of a parliamentary delegation from Myanmar led by the Speaker of the Upper House of the Parliament His Excellency U Khin Aung Myint whom I had The member for Sturt has been warned once that they are able to meet their everyday expenses It is this government that is also delivering
