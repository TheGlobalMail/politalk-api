<p>I move:</p><p pwmotiontext="moved">
That this House records its deep regret at the death on 2 February 2006 of the Honourable Sir Reginald William Colin Swartz KBE, ED, a former federal minister, Leader of the House of Representatives and Member for Darling Downs, Queensland, and places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.
</p><p>The late Reg Swartz was a member of that group collectively described as ‘Forty-Niners’. They were a group of members who came into the federal parliament with the election of the Menzies government in 1949. They were overwhelmingly, but not completely, members of the coalition side of the House because of two factors. The first factor was the expansion of the parliament from 74 members to 124, decided upon by the Chifley government, which accompanied the expansion of the Senate and the change in the voting system in the election of senators. The second factor, of course, was the scale of the Menzies victory in 1949. I understand that there are now only two remaining Forty-Niners: on the Labor side, Clyde Cameron, the former member for Hindmarsh and, on the coalition side, Allen Fairhall, the former defence minister and former member for Paterson.</p><p>Reg Swartz’s membership of the House of Representatives was neatly coextensive with the period of coalition government between 1949 and 1972 but, having said that, he was a man liked and respected on both sides of the parliament. It was due in part to the extraordinary camaraderie that existed across the political divide between the men who had fought in World War II and particularly those, like Reg Swartz, who had fallen into captivity when the allies surrendered in Singapore. Reg Swartz along with many others had to endure years of imprisonment at the hands of the Japanese. He spent time in Changi and also a period working on the Burma-Thailand railway. When the war ended in 1945 he returned to Australia.</p><p>Reg Swartz was born on 14 April 1911 and was educated at Toowoomba Grammar School. At the age of 17 he joined the CMF and later enlisted in the 2nd AIF, serving with the 2nd/26th Infantry Battalion and the 8th Division in the Malayan campaign. Before entering parliament he had worked as an oil company executive and, as I said earlier, he was elected to federal parliament to represent the Queensland seat of Darling Downs, a seat he held continuously until 1972.</p><p>He held a number of portfolios and for the last two years of the McMahon government he was Leader of the House. He was a person who had a great capacity to calm the House at question time. When I first became a junior minister in the Fraser government, there was an expression, ‘the Reg Swartz award’, and it was meant to describe a very lengthy answer. So if you won the award, it did not necessarily mean that you were enjoying the approval of the then Prime Minister.</p><p>Perhaps the most moving and poignant association I had with Reg Swartz was in 1998 when, as Prime Minister, I had the privilege of travelling to Thailand to Kanchanaburi to open the Hellfire Pass Memorial. As well as being accompanied by a significant number of former prisoners of war, a group put together by the Department of Veterans’ Affairs, I invited three former members of this parliament who had been prisoners of war of the Japanese: Sir Reginald Swartz; Sir John Carrick, the former government leader in the Senate; and Mr Tom Uren, the former Labor minister and a person well known on both sides of this parliament and well liked by many current and former members of the parliament. To be associated with those three men—and in terms of age and rank Reg Swartz was the senior of the three—was to be reminded of the remarkable spirit that kept them going during those dreadful times of captivity.</p><p>Curly Swartz, as he was known—a traditional Australian acknowledgement of his baldness—was the Leader of the House, a role he performed very well. He held a number of portfolios and he continued in his life outside of parliament in the CMF. He became a lieutenant colonel as Assistant Quartermaster General, Northern Command; and he was made an honorary colonel of the Australian Army Aviation Corps in 1969. He was created a Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire in June 1972 and appointed a Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire for distinguished services in the south-west Pacific.</p><p>In retirement Reg Swartz pursued his many and varied interests. He lived a very full life. He married a second time, after the death of his first wife. He died last week at the remarkable age of 94. The government has offered, and the family has accepted, a state funeral, which will be held in Caloundra on Thursday this week.</p><p>On behalf of the government and on behalf of the members of the Liberal Party throughout Australia—we are a party that Reg Swartz was proud to remain a member of and serve with such commitment and distinction—I record my gratitude for his service. He belonged to a remarkable generation of Australians who endured terrible suffering, came back with great hope and great optimism about the future of this country and then set about dedicating the rest of what was to be, in his case, a very long and fruitful life, to the service of his country both publicly and privately.</p><p>So on behalf of the government I extend to his wife, Lady Muriel Swartz, and his children Barbara, Graham and Rodney, and to other family members and friends, our very deep sympathy on their loss and in their bereavement.</p> </speech>

<p>I support the motion moved by the Prime Minister and add to the remarks that he made. Sir Reginald Swartz was one of the last two surviving ministers of the Menzies government—Sir Allen Fairhall, who retired from parliament in 1969 on the grounds of ill health, still lives. Reginald Swartz was the member for Darling Downs for 23 years. He was first elected in 1949 and served as a minister in the Menzies, Holt, McEwan and Gorton governments. He was Leader of the House of Representatives from 1971 until 1972 and he held a range of portfolios, including Repatriation, Health, Social Services, Civil Aviation and National Development.</p><p>Obviously, I do not have personal memories of Reginald Swartz in quite the same way that the Prime Minister has—he was of the Prime Minister’s party. But I can remember him, as a young person, when I visited this parliament—or the other parliament, I should say—every August and watched the performances at question time. There was an audible groan whenever Reg Swartz rose to his feet because there would be an answer given, but it would not be a read answer; it would be an answer that had an incredible amount of factoids added to it that made the various points that he wanted to make. He would absolutely be guaranteed to comatose any question time he involved himself in.</p><p>I remember with some pleasure, when I got to my feet early on as a minister in this place and was able to make the statement that I wanted to dedicate my answer to the memory of Reginald Swartz, being gratified by the groans that broke out in the then opposition on the Liberal side, who knew exactly what I meant when that question was going to be answered. But he was widely regarded on both sides of the House as being a man of decency and integrity. I know my father thought the world of him. One of the attributes of politics in those days, particularly when you held the sorts of portfolios that Reg Swartz held, was that you had many issues that members of parliament were, in a constituency sense, interested in. He was one of those ministers who, when you had a bit of an issue with repatriation or social services, it was not a bad idea to give him notice of your question. If he had a favourable answer, whatever side of the House you were on, he would give it to you—at length, in detail and totally to the satisfaction of your constituent, provided you had taken the trouble to arrange things beforehand.</p><p>Sir Reginald Swartz won election after election by sizeable majorities. That was probably a result of his practice of insisting that he visit every single town and village in his electorate every year between elections, despite the fact that he had a very substantial majority. He was well served by his press secretary, the late Mort Nash, who used to boast that he was firmly of the view that his job was to keep his boss out of the <i>Sydney Morning Herald</i> and in the <i>Toowoomba Chronicle</i>. By and large, the press secretary succeeded in his objectives. All of us in this place, whenever an occasion arises to do so, ought to express gratitude to the generation from which Reg Swartz came. It was undoubtedly the most significant, stoic, effective generation in Australian history—the people who lasted the Depression, the people who won the war.</p><p>Reg Swartz was a member of that generation. He did it as hard as any member of that generation did. After being enlisted in the 2/22nd Infantry Battalion, 8th Division, and participating in the Malayan campaign—which, despite the fact that it has been overshadowed by the surrender at Singapore, had many features that demonstrated effective delaying actions—he was captured, became a prisoner in Changi and had the most horrible of all wars as a result of that. Nevertheless, it needs to be noted that that generation came back with a sense of personal solidarity, a sense of the ability of the government to achieve things and a sense of national responsibility, which made them such effective participants in the political life of this nation. On behalf of the Labor Party, I extend my sympathy to his second wife, Lady Muriel Swartz, and his children, Barbara, Graham and Rodney.</p> </speech>

<p>I would like to join with the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in this condolence motion for Reg Swartz. The reason I do so is that he was a friend and a colleague of my father’s and a friend also of my mother’s. He was  therefore somebody who was close to our family so, as a family, we very much grieve his passing.</p><p>Reg Swartz and my father had a good deal in common. They were born within one year of each other—Reg Swartz being one year younger—and both of them were members of the AIF during World War II in Malaya, in the retreat down the Malay Peninsula to Singapore, and were incarcerated in the Changi prisoner of war camp. As you have heard from the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, Reg Swartz also went to work on the infamous Thai-Burma Railway, something my father managed not to do.</p><p>Reg Swartz was a man of enormous courage and determination to have survived those simply indescribable and appalling experiences, and I think it is important that we all acknowledge the great courage he showed through that time. He was also elected to the House of Representatives on the same day as my father in 1949. My father was one of the ‘Forty-niners’, a generation of Liberal politicians—or coalition politicians—</p> </speech>

<p>I am glad you picked that one up—who regarded themselves as particularly triumphant, having turfed out the Chifley government and begun the long and very successful regime of Liberal governments up until 1972, when Reg Swartz left the parliament. During that period, Reg Swartz was one of those ‘Forty-niners’ who served the parliament with distinction as a minister. He was a minister in the Menzies, Holt and Gorton governments. He would be particularly well remembered for his time as Minister for Civil Aviation, a portfolio he held for three years. But he was also Minister for Repatriation—what we today call ‘Veterans’ Affairs’—Minister for Health in 1964, Minister for Social Security in 1965 and finally Minister for National Development and Leader of the House.</p><p>Reg Swartz was an important figure in the history of the Liberal Party. He represented what is now the electorate of Groom—in those days it was Darling Downs—and the city of Toowoomba. I know that he did so with real distinction and was a very popular member. Today is a sad day to reflect on a man who had such a great career. He gave a lot to Australia and did so successfully. He is survived by his second wife, Lady Muriel, and his children Barbara, Graham and Rodney. I extend my condolences to all of them.</p> </speech>

<p>I am pleased to be associated with the remarks of the Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Kim Beazley in this condolence motion for Sir Reginald Swartz. As we have heard, Sir Reginald was elected to this place in 1949 and this followed his service to the nation during World War II. He first joined the CMF at the age of 17 in 1928. He later enlisted in the AIF at the rank of captain and served with the 2/26 Infantry Battalion, 8th Division during the Malaysian campaign. Sir Reginald was captured by the Japanese and held in Changi. He was also forced to work on the infamous Burma-Thailand railway until the end of the war. He was repatriated to Australia in 1945. As the Prime Minister has indicated, Sir Reginald continued his association with the CMF until 1969, when he was appointed honorary colonel of the Australian Army Aviation Corp. His direct experience in World War II resulted in him being given the portfolio responsibility of repatriation, in which he served for three years. Sir Reginald also visited the troops in Vietnam in 1970—the year I was there. In his first speech to the parliament in 1950, he said in relation to the Japanese:</p><p class="italic">… I wish to leave a thought in the minds of honorable members in relation to our future co-operation with Japan. It has been suggested that the time has arrived when Japan should again take its place in international councils. Having lived with the Japanese for some years under rather curious conditions, and knowing their characteristics fairly well, I offer some advice to the Minister for External Affairs (Mr Spender). I suggest to the honorable gentleman that we should use the Japanese internationally, but that we should never trust them.</p><p>As Minister for National Development, Sir Reginald visited Japan in 1970, and that must have been a very personal and emotional experience for him. His attitude to Australia’s dealings with Japan immediately after the war took much courage, and he certainly showed great leadership. At that time many former POWs and other Australians took a totally different attitude towards trade and involvement with that country.</p><p>I understand that Sir Reginald Swartz was held in high esteem by both sides of the parliament. This would have been a direct reflection of the strong mateship that must have existed in the parliament at that time among those who served the nation during the war and ended up on either side of politics. I also understand that he was held in high esteem by the veterans of Australia and his comrades in arms, whom he served as Minister for Repatriation. On behalf of the ALP, I join with Kim Beazley in extending our sympathy to his wife, Lady Muriel Swartz, and his children Barbara, Graham and Rodney.</p><p>Question agreed to, honourable members standing in their places.</p> </speech>

<p>On 24 January I announced a number of changes to the ministry consequent upon certain resignations. The swearing-in took place on 27 January 2006. For the information of honourable members, I table an updated list of the full ministry with some minor changes to the Senate representation to that published in the list dated 30 January 2006. I also advise that the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer will be absent from question time today and tomorrow. He, along with some other members on both sides of the House, is representing the parliament at the Australian Future Directions Forum.

<p>I thank the member for Boothby for his question and for his interest. Let me first say that I do condemn—and the government condemns—the violent protests that we have seen in Lebanon, Turkey, Syria, Iran, Afghanistan and, indeed, a number of other countries. This violence has been directed mainly at Danish and Norwegian interests, simply because these were the countries in which these cartoons were published. There has been some backlash to New Zealand as well.</p><p>But let me make this clear: we regard the backlash as indefensible and urge people to desist and remain calm. In this country, of course, we believe in the right to protest, but we only believe in the right to protest peacefully—not violently: not to burn down buildings and not to threaten people. If people do take offence at anything—and this happens from time to time in any society—if they are exercised about anything, they have a right to protest, but they should not resort to violence.</p><p>We hear reports that up to five people have been killed in these protests. There is no doubt that the cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad have caused offence to many Muslims, and that is unfortunate. But the decision about whether to publish such material is in the end a matter for the media. Freedom of speech is a cornerstone of a democratic society, not just in this country but in democratic societies all around the world.</p><p>Suffice it to say that with all freedoms, with all rights, come responsibilities, and any media organisation which publishes this material will obviously have given consideration to what the consequences of doing so might be. But, having said that, at the end of the day, in a free society, people have a right to express their views. If others disagree with those views or are offended by those views, they have absolutely the right to protest, to object, but only in peaceful ways.</p><p>While I will not go into the details of the security provisions at Australian missions overseas, let me just say that our mission in Ramallah in the Palestinian territories has been closed temporarily because it shares a building with the Danish mission. Of course, the Danish mission has been particularly subjected to protests. We are liaising to ensure the security of Danish consulates here in Australia. There is not a Danish embassy, but there are consulates. We are obviously focused on the security of those missions.</p><p>Today my department is reissuing its travel advisories for Lebanon, Syria, Israel and Iran, noting that large demonstrations related to this issue have taken place in those countries and advising Australians to avoid any further such protests and to exercise good personal security awareness.</p> </speech>

<p>That statement was based on quite widely circulated material—and I refer in particular to an address by the British foreign secretary, Mr Jack Straw; for the benefit of the member, I will get him the precise reference—and also plenty of open source reports at the time which suggested that a number of things were happening: that Saddam was selling oil on a bilateral basis to bypass the UN sanction and was also adopting the practice of leaving unspent amounts in the United Nations escrow account and then pointing to the inevitable suffering of his own people to support his argument that the suffering was due to the behaviour of the allies. That is the basis of the claim, and it is totally accurate.</p> </speech>

<p>I thank the member for Cowper for his question and recognise the enormous input into the local economy in his area that exports have, particularly from small and medium sized enterprises. Figures were released last week that indicated that in 2005 Australia reached a new annual record of exports, of $176.7 billion, a 15 per cent increase on 2004, which was also a significant figure. I will just repeat it: $176.7 billion in 2005.</p><p>We saw new annual records set across a number of areas, particularly—obviously—in the resources sector, but also in the services sector. Interestingly, manufactured exports rose by nine per cent. Contrary to all the doom-saying comments by the Australian Labor Party, manufacturing exports rose by nine per cent. Australia’s export businesses deserve to be congratulated for this result, achieved in different global economic circumstances. We have taken the advantage where we have competitive advantages, and obviously in the resources sector. Australian exporters are taking up the opportunities provided by our government’s strong economic record, the stability of the economy and our trade policies in terms of opening up markets across the world.</p><p>It was interesting to note within those figures that 12 out of our top 20 export products reached new record levels—and not just resources, not just commodity exports. Coal, iron ore, education, beef, aluminium ores, natural gas, professional and business services, passenger motor vehicles, medicines, alcoholic beverages, including wine, and copper ores all reached new record levels in 2005. So 12 out of our top 20 exports reached new records. What are the private sector forecasters indicating is going to happen? I quote the ANZ <i>Economic Outlook</i>:</p><p class="italic">The Australian economy will return to the good times over the next two years on the back of solid business investment, a strengthening in resources and rural exports.</p><p>So the path that the government have gone down in terms of our policy settings to ensure that the economic environment and the workplace structures in Australia are ripe to take advantage of opportunities in the future is absolutely the right one. It was opposed all the way by the Australian Labor Party, but we will continue to work with and listen to the job creators in our country.</p> </speech>

<p>My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer him again to his 25 March 2003 statement to parliament that:</p><p class="italic">... the oil for food program has been immorally and shamefully rorted by Saddam Hussein, who has used the proceeds of it to acquire his weapons capacity ...</p><p>Given that you have just said that the rort was widely known and that the AWB was the largest single user of the oil for food program worldwide, why didn’t it occur to the Prime Minister to investigate whether there were any problems with the AWB?</p> </speech>

<p>At that time it was common between the government and the opposition that the AWB was an organisation of total integrity and repute. On 6 June 2003, three months after I made my statement to the parliament, there was a response to the allegations made by the American Wheat Associates—allegations, incidentally, as to their detail before the commission. Mr Cole has indicated that he will be very carefully examining the role of the AWB and also the Commonwealth in relation to that issue. This is what the then shadow minister for primary industries, Senator Kerry O’Brien, and the then trade spokesman, Craig Emerson, had to say, such was their belief in the integrity of AWB Ltd—</p> </speech>

<p>With regard to trade, the global orthodoxy is to free trade. I make yet another plea tonight that, in assessing trade policy, we take it from the view of fair trade—that we look at the way in which Australia can compete against trading nations in a fair way. Too many decisions are made on the basis of businesses going offshore. Look at the northern suburbs of Melbourne: Deeko, a paper manufacturer; a webbing factory for seatbelts; a biscuit manufacturer in Broadmeadows—hundreds of jobs going to China; in Mentone, Armstrong-Nylex—a couple of hundred jobs going to Malaysia. If we do not realise that the only way that we can have proper trade is to do it on the basis of fair trade, it will be to the detriment of Australia.</p> </speech>
